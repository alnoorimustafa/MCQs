        "explanation": "The capacity for mentalizing grows out of attachment theory and refers to a person’s ability to conceive of his or her own and others’ mental states as explanations of behavior. Hence, it is related to psychological mindedness. The psychodynamic clinician assesses the ability of a patient to see that his or her behavior grows out of a set of beliefs, feelings, and perspectives that are not necessarily the same as others’. Like empathy, mentalizing requires a capacity to sense what is going on in another’s mind and respond accordingly. This capacity to be sensitive to what others are feeling and to know that one’s internal states contribute to one’s behavior augurs well for a more exploratory or interpretative approach in dynamic psychotherapy.

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Transference is the displacement of feelings and thoughts associated with a figure in the patient’s past onto the therapist. Transference is often unconscious, at least initially, and the patient is often puzzled by their behavior towards the therapist because it does not make sense, based on who the therapist really is. Hence the enactment of missing a session or of coming late to a session may reveal unconscious transference. The prevailing view about transference is that the therapist’s actual behavior always influences the patient’s experience of the therapist. Hence the transference to the therapist is partly based on real characteristics and partly on figures from the patient’s past: a combination of old and new relationships. Many therapists believe that interpretation of this transference is an essential process of psychodynamic psychotherapy. Gabbard says that one should postpone the interpretation of transference until it becomes a resistance and until it is close to the patient’s awareness. In other words, if things are going reasonably well, it makes no sense to interpret transference. If the patient develops, for example, erotized or highly negative feelings, which impede the process of the therapy, interpretation may be essential. Many therapists regard treatment that focuses on transference as more exploratory than therapy geared to extra-transference relationships. In supportive therapy, interpretation of the transference may be minimized, although the therapist may silently interpret the transference as a way of increasing his or her understanding of the patient.

        },
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Freud used the term counter-transference to describe the analyst’s transference towards the patient. In other words, the patient might remind the therapist of someone from the therapist’s past, so that the therapist starts to treat the patient as though he or she were that figure. Over time, this view of counter-transference was broadened to include the total emotional reaction of the therapist to the patient. Today it is recognized that counter-transference is jointly created—it partly involves the therapist’s past relationships, but it also involves feelings induced in the therapist by the patient’s behavior. Counter-transference is variously defined as (1) the analyst’s or psychotherapist’s transference reactions to the patient; (2) his or her reactions to the patient’s transferences; and (3) any reactions, feelings and attitudes of the analyst or therapist toward the patient, regardless of their source. These responses are manifestations of the requisite engagement by the therapist or analyst in the emotional process of treatment. Moreover, these reactions are a rich source of understanding of the patient’s experience as it touches the therapist affectively. Gabbard GO.

Narcissistic defenses (denial, distortion, and projection) are the most primitive and appear in children and persons who are psychotically disturbed. Immature defenses (acting out, passive-aggression, blocking, introjection, and regression) are seen in adolescents and some non-psychotic patients. Neurotic defenses (dissociation, displacement, intellectualization, isolation, reaction formation, and repression) are encountered in obsessive–compulsive and hysterical patients as well as in adults under stress. Mature defenses according to Vaillant are altruism, anticipation, asceticism, humor, sublimation, and suppression. These mechanisms often are used in healthy coping mechanisms.

            "E": "Carry out an extensive assessment of risk to the child"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the USA, therapists have a legal duty to warn and protect third parties endangered by their patients. In the UK, there is no binding requirement on clinicians to disclose dangerousness. The decision to disclose is based on the judgement that the responsibility to protect the public outweighs the duty to the patient to protect confidentiality. The clinician has the responsibility to make a considered decision whether or not to infringe the right to confidentiality. Statute law (e.g. notification of diseases) determines when the clinician ‘must’ infringe that right; case law when he ‘may’ do so. Most psychotherapy falls under the latter. Each case must be considered on its merits, possibly on the basis of a risk assessment, and where there is a doubt, the clinician must discuss it with another clinician. In any case, welfare of children is of foremost importance. In this particular case, Lisa said she was abusing her children. We do not know what she meant by ‘abuse’. So, as common sense would inform, the first step is for the therapist to confirm what she means by ‘abuse’. If there is a need, the next step would be an informed risk assessment. Confidentiality and disclosure are usually discussed with the patient before therapy. Since there is a potential risk to children, ending the session and reassuring Lisa about confidentiality are obviously wrong choices. Premature reporting to social services would result in unnecessary labeling and also possible loss of rapport and therapeutic alliance. Criticizing her would also lead to a break in the therapeutic relationship and would be against the principles of ‘unconditional positive regard’. If there is a case for disclosure, the patient herself should be encouraged to disclose to social services, as this would be in the best interests of the children involved and the patient. It is generally thought that inexperienced staff and students should not inquire about abuse or ask known victims about details of their experience, although they may be approached by patients making tentative attempts at disclosure, the general rule must be that inexperienced individuals should not invite discussion of a sensitive subject such as sexual abuse unless they are being supervised and trained to deal with it. In this case, it is thought that the psychotherapist is being supervised and would do a general risk assessment based on history and mental state. Gabbard GO, Beck JS, and Holmes J.

        },
        "correct_answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Otto Kernberg proposed the term ‘borderline personality organization’ (BPO), a broad concept encompassing all severe personality disorders. BPO is a stable permanent state based on four criteria: diffuse identity; primitive defenses, including splitting, projection, and projective identification; intact reality testing that is prone to alterations and failures because of aggression; and object relations characterized by splitting. The term ‘Identity diffusion’ was developed by Erikson and later used by Kernberg in his concept of BPO. In psychodynamic terms an individual with identity diffusion has not integrated good self-images with bad, and, instead, has multiple, contradictory self-images, some good, some bad. These are invoked at different times and in different situations so that a meaningful, integrated image of the self is never formed. Salman Akhtar delineates the syndrome of identity diffusion as consisting of six clinical features: (1) contradictory character traits, (2) temporal discontinuity in the self, (3) lack of authenticity, (4) feelings of emptiness, (5) gender dysphoria, and (6) inordinate ethnic and moral relativism. This syndrome implies severe personality pathology. The inner world in BPO according to Kernberg, is characterized by split objects. Instead of stable and smoothly integrated internal representations of people and their relationships, the self and others are experienced in contrasts of either black or white – ‘no grey zones’. These people generally have an intact reality testing, but are prone to breaks in it, leading to the so-called ‘micropsychotic’ episodes. S Akhtar. The syndrome of identity diffusion.

Resistance is thought of as the patient’s attempt to protect her or himself by avoiding the anticipated emotional discomfort that accompanies the emergence of conflictual, dangerous, or painful experiences, feelings, thoughts, memories, needs, and desires. Resistance occurs through the use of unconscious defense mechanisms. The recognition, clarification, and interpretation of resistance constitute important activities of the psychoanalyst and the psychoanalytic psychotherapist, both of whom must first appreciate how a patient is warding off anxiety before understanding why he or she is so compelled.

These include psychological mindedness: curiosity about oneself and the capacity for self-scrutiny. Those who are unable to articulate and comprehend their inner thoughts and feelings cannot negotiate with the fundamental analytical words and their meanings. The inability to examine one’s own motivations and behaviors precludes benefits from the analytical method. Introspectiveness: the person should be able to experience and learn from intense affects or conflicts without acting them out. The person should be able to form reasonable object relationships, usually the capacity to form and maintain, as well as to detach from, a trusting object relationship is essential. High motivation: the patient needs a strong motivation to persevere, in light of the rigors of intense and lengthy treatment. The desire for health and self-understanding must surpass the neurotic need for unhappiness. The person should be able to tolerate frustration and therapeutic regression. Sadock BJ and Sadock VA.

Berne defined psychological ‘games’ as stereotyped and predictable transactions that people learn in childhood and continue to play throughout their lives. Strokes, the basic motivating factors of human behavior consist of specific rewards such as approval and love. All people have three ego states that exist within them: the child (the primitive element), the adult (the reality element), and the parent (an introject of the values of a person’s actual parents). The therapeutic process helps people to understand whether they are functioning in a child, adult or parent mode when interacting with others. It is thought that as patients learn to recognize characteristic games being repeated throughout life, they can ultimately function in the adult mode as much as possible in interpersonal relationships.

        "explanation": "Core beliefs are global, rigid, absolute, and overgeneralized convictions about the self, others, and the personal world that have powerful effects on how we perceive ourselves and our context. They often have their root in early childhood development. An example of core beliefs is ‘I’m incompetent’. These lie dormant until they are activated by certain situations (which reflect childhood events that laid down the core belief). At the next level are ‘intermediate thoughts’, which consist of rules, assumptions, and attitudes that we use to evaluate ourselves as well as other people and personal experiences. On most occasions, these rules tend to contradict the core belief (in a way reinforcing them). Examples of intermediary beliefs might be ‘I need to succeed in everything I do, in order for me to be seen as competent’. A special class of intermediary beliefs is the conditional rule, which takes the form of ‘If … then’ statements (e.g. ‘If I succeed in everything I do, only then others will consider me competent’). Automatic thoughts are cognitions that intervene between external events and a person’s emotional reaction to the event. For example, the belief that people will laugh at me when I don’t get a distinction at the exam is an automatic thought that occurs to someone who has the aforementioned ‘core belief’. Gabbard GO.

This distortion is especially prominent in obsessions, is closely related to guilt, and is associated with subsequent attempts at neutralization. A comparable cognitive distortion termed ‘thought–shape fusion’ is thought to be present in a minority of people with eating problems and occurs when the thought of eating induces feelings of fatness, moral unacceptability, and weight gain.

        "explanation": "Examining the evidence is a technique in which the therapist and patient collaboratively explore the evidence for and the evidence against a specific distorted thought or belief. When working through the exercise, the therapist asks the patient to write the thought or belief at the top of a piece of paper and then label two columns with ‘evidence for’ and ‘evidence against’ the thought. The patient is then guided to explore methodically and write down each piece of evidence. At the end of this procedure, the evidence for and against the cognition is quantified and estimated. Guided discovery is the most frequently used technique to help patients articulate automatic thoughts in sessions. The specific technique used is called Socratic questioning. One of the most powerful ways of teaching patients to detect automatic thoughts is to find a real-life example of how automatic thoughts influence their emotional responses. A shift in mood during the therapy session can be an opportune time for the therapist to facilitate the identification of automatic thoughts. The Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire devised by Hollon and Kendall is a comprehensive list of dysfunctional thoughts that has been used primarily in research studies. Similar lists can be used in clinical settings when patients are having difficulty detecting their automatic thoughts.

These include brief individual CBT (including ERP) using structured self-help materials; brief individual CBT (including ERP) by telephone; group CBT (including ERP) (note, the patient may receive more than 10 hours of therapy in this format). Those with mild functional impairment who are unable to engage in low intensity CBT (including ERP), or for whom low-intensity treatment has proved to be inadequate, should be offered the choice of either a course of an SSRI or more intensive CBT (including ERP) (more than 10 therapist hours per patient). Adults with OCD with moderate functional impairment should be offered the choice of either a course of an SSRI or more intensive CBT (including ERP) (more than 10 therapist hours per patient). Adults with OCD with severe functional impairment should be offered combined treatment with an SSRI and CBT (including ERP). NICE. CG31 Obsessive-compulsive disorder: NICE guideline.

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Schema-based approaches in cognitive therapy are based on the original ideas of Beck. Early life experiences produce a number of thought patterns or schemata. These thought patterns are like ‘block molds’ into which thoughts fit in when evaluating events. They are otherwise called core beliefs. These result in underlying ‘assumptions’ which reinforce the core beliefs and from these arise the negative automatic thoughts. Schemata are thought to be dormant, and get activated during a depressive episode. Schemata are patterns of unconditional beliefs that are hard to access and are self-maintaining. There are thought to be three main processes that maintain schemata. Schema surrender is the process where the person seeks evidence that supports the beliefs and dismisses any evidence to the contrary. Schema compensation refers to compensating for the core belief by doing the exact opposite, but, ultimately, this action acts as a reinforcer that maintains the schema, as in the case described in the question. Ultimately, the person believes that the family loves him only because he is self-sacrificing, and if he was not, he would still remain unlovable. Schema avoidance is a group of blocking behaviors that help avoid emotional arousal – e.g. comfort eating. Naismith J and Grant S. Seminars in the Psychotherapies. Gaskell, 2007, p. 149."

        "correct_answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Salkovskis described five characteristic dysfunctional assumptions in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The first option refers to thought–action fusion, i.e. having a thought equates to performing the action. This is consistent with the thoughts of patients with OCD, especially those who have ‘violent’ obsessions. The second statement that a person should (and can) exercise control over one’s thoughts is also consistent with thoughts in OCD. Responsibility is not attenuated by other factors (e.g. the low probability of occurrence) is a typical assumption in patients with OCD. The fourth option is also typical of an obsessive cognition. The final option is an assumption that is not typical of OCD. This is probably more typical of a depressive assumption that reinforces the core belief ‘I am a failure’. As a corollary, there may be another secondary assumption – ‘If I please everyone, I am considered successful’. Freeman C and Power M.

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Parent management training was first established as a treatment program by Gerald Patterson in the 1970s. The program was based on the principles of learning theory, both operant theories and social learning theories, which teach parents to use positive reinforcers, like stickers, toys, or snacks to increase positive behavior, while using time out tactics to reduce negative behavior like temper tantrums. Focus is on one problem behavior at a time. The parents are taught to observe the problem behavior – the situations and timings at which it occurs. The frequency of this behavior is usually charted to look at the progress, while abstinence from the behavior is positively rewarded and indulgence in the behavior is rewarded with time outs. Parents are also taught to identify behaviors that are incompatible with the ‘problem’ behavior – e.g. talking nicely instead of whining. These are called ‘competing’ behaviors – and these are usually rewarded. Consistency in rewarding and punishing is important in this setting. This treatment is usually used in childhood disruptive disorders such as oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder. Shaping and chaining are operant techniques used to induce target behaviors. Approximating ‘da’ and ‘da’ to form the word ‘dada’ – to which the daddy hugs the child (reinforcer) is an example of shaping. Chaining is linking of more complex tasks such as wearing a pull-over shirt – this consists of a number of complex steps. Modeling is a social learning technique where a social behavior is reinforced by society. For example a student who changes dress to fit in with a certain group of students has a strong likelihood of being accepted and thus reinforced by that group."

        "explanation": "Systematic desensitization was first developed by Joseph Wolpe in the 1950s to treat phobic patients. It is based on the principles of counter-conditioning. It attempts to replace the ‘fear’ response to phobic stimuli with a new response (muscle relaxation) that is incompatible with fear. The first step in systematic desensitization is to train the clients in deep relaxation until they can rapidly achieve muscle relaxation when instructed to do so. The second step is to construct what is known as an ‘anxiety hierarchy’, in which the client’s feared situations are ordered from the least to the most anxiety-provoking. Thus, for example, a person with phobia for ‘cockroaches’ might regard a photograph of a cockroach as only modestly threatening, but a large, rapidly moving cockroach close by as highly threatening. The client reaches a state of deep relaxation, and is then asked to imagine (or is confronted by the photograph of a cockroach) the least threatening situation in the anxiety hierarchy. The client repeatedly imagines (or is confronted by) this situation until it fails to evoke any anxiety at all, indicating that the counter-conditioning has been successful. This process is repeated while working through the levels in the anxiety hierarchy until the most anxiety-provoking situation is reached. Gelder M, Harrison P, and Cowen P.

        "explanation": "Orgasmic reconditioning was first described by Marquis in 1970. In this treatment, the individual is asked to masturbate regularly to their troublesome deviant fantasies, but at the point of orgasmic inevitability, to switch to a desired non-deviant fantasy. As treatment progresses, the non-deviant stimulus is introduced earlier and earlier in the arousal process until masturbation is achieved without the deviant fantasy. This technique obviously is used when the behavior or sexual preference that is of concern is not in itself dangerous or causing a public nuisance. Following the treatment, further sexual and social skills training is usually needed to ensure that the arousal to non-deviant stimuli is maintained."
