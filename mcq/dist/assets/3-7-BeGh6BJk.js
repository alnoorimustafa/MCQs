Hence, it is related to psychological mindedness. The psychodynamic clinician assesses the ability of a patient to see that his or her behavior grows out of a set of beliefs, feelings, and perspectives that are not necessarily the same as others’. Like empathy, mentalizing requires a capacity to sense what is going on in another’s mind and respond accordingly. This capacity to be sensitive to what others are feeling and to know that one’s internal states contribute to one’s behavior augurs well for a more exploratory or interpretative approach in dynamic psychotherapy.

Transference is often unconscious, at least initially, and the patient is often puzzled by their behavior towards the therapist because it does not make sense, based on who the therapist really is. Hence the enactment of missing a session or of coming late to a session may reveal unconscious transference. The prevailing view about transference is that the therapist’s actual behavior always influences the patient’s experience of the therapist. Hence the transference to the therapist is partly based on real characteristics and partly on figures from the patient’s past: a combination of old and new relationships. Many therapists believe that interpretation of this transference is an essential process of psychodynamic psychotherapy. Gabbard says that one should postpone the interpretation of transference until it becomes a resistance and until it is close to the patient’s awareness. In other words, if things are going reasonably well, it makes no sense to interpret transference. If the patient develops, for example, erotized or highly negative feelings, which impede the process of the therapy, interpretation may be essential. Many therapists regard treatment that focuses on transference as more exploratory than therapy geared to extra-transference relationships. In supportive therapy, interpretation of the transference may be minimized, although the therapist may silently interpret the transference as a way of increasing his or her understanding of the patient.

In other words, the patient might remind the therapist of someone from the therapist’s past, so that the therapist starts to treat the patient as though he or she were that figure. Over time, this view of counter-transference was broadened to include the total emotional reaction of the therapist to the patient. Today it is recognized that counter-transference is jointly created—it partly involves the therapist’s past relationships, but it also involves feelings induced in the therapist by the patient’s behavior. Counter-transference is variously defined as (1) the analyst’s or psychotherapist’s transference reactions to the patient; (2) his or her reactions to the patient’s transferences; and (3) any reactions, feelings and attitudes of the analyst or therapist toward the patient, regardless of their source. These responses are manifestations of the requisite engagement by the therapist or analyst in the emotional process of treatment. Moreover, these reactions are a rich source of understanding of the patient’s experience as it touches the therapist affectively. Gabbard GO.

Which of the following is a mature defense?","options":{"A":"Suppression","B":"Repression","C":"Dissociation","D":"Passive aggression","E":"Denial"},"correct_answer":"A","explanation":"George Vaillant classified defenses hierarchically according to the relative degree of maturity associated with them. Narcissistic defenses (denial, distortion, and projection) are the most primitive and appear in children and persons who are psychotically disturbed. Immature defenses (acting out, passive-aggression, blocking, introjection, and regression) are seen in adolescents and some non-psychotic patients. Neurotic defenses (dissociation, displacement, intellectualization, isolation, reaction formation, and repression) are encountered in obsessive–compulsive and hysterical patients as well as in adults under stress. Mature defenses according to Vaillant are altruism, anticipation, asceticism, humor, sublimation, and suppression. These mechanisms often are used in healthy coping mechanisms.

In the UK, there is no binding requirement on clinicians to disclose dangerousness. The decision to disclose is based on the judgement that the responsibility to protect the public outweighs the duty to the patient to protect confidentiality. The clinician has the responsibility to make a considered decision whether or not to infringe the right to confidentiality. Statute law (e.g. notification of diseases) determines when the clinician ‘must’ infringe that right; case law when he ‘may’ do so. Most psychotherapy falls under the latter. Each case must be considered on its merits, possibly on the basis of a risk assessment, and where there is a doubt, the clinician must discuss it with another clinician. In any case, welfare of children is of foremost importance. In this particular case, Lisa said she was abusing her children. We do not know what she meant by ‘abuse’. So, as common sense would inform, the first step is for the therapist to confirm what she means by ‘abuse’. If there is a need, the next step would be an informed risk assessment. Confidentiality and disclosure are usually discussed with the patient before therapy. Since there is a potential risk to children, ending the session and reassuring Lisa about confidentiality are obviously wrong choices. Premature reporting to social services would result in unnecessary labeling and also possible loss of rapport and therapeutic alliance. Criticizing her would also lead to a break in the therapeutic relationship and would be against the principles of ‘unconditional positive regard’. If there is a case for disclosure, the patient herself should be encouraged to disclose to social services, as this would be in the best interests of the children involved and the patient. It is generally thought that inexperienced staff and students should not inquire about abuse or ask known victims about details of their experience, although they may be approached by patients making tentative attempts at disclosure, the general rule must be that inexperienced individuals should not invite discussion of a sensitive subject such as sexual abuse unless they are being supervised and trained to deal with it. In this case, it is thought that the psychotherapist is being supervised and would do a general risk assessment based on history and mental state. Gabbard GO, Beck JS, and Holmes J.

BPO is a stable permanent state based on four criteria: diffuse identity; primitive defenses, including splitting, projection, and projective identification; intact reality testing that is prone to alterations and failures because of aggression; and object relations characterized by splitting. The term ‘Identity diffusion’ was developed by Erikson and later used by Kernberg in his concept of BPO. In psychodynamic terms an individual with identity diffusion has not integrated good self-images with bad, and, instead, has multiple, contradictory self-images, some good, some bad. These are invoked at different times and in different situations so that a meaningful, integrated image of the self is never formed. Salman Akhtar delineates the syndrome of identity diffusion as consisting of six clinical features: (1) contradictory character traits, (2) temporal discontinuity in the self, (3) lack of authenticity, (4) feelings of emptiness, (5) gender dysphoria, and (6) inordinate ethnic and moral relativism. This syndrome implies severe personality pathology. The inner world in BPO according to Kernberg, is characterized by split objects. Instead of stable and smoothly integrated internal representations of people and their relationships, the self and others are experienced in contrasts of either black or white – ‘no grey zones’. These people generally have an intact reality testing, but are prone to breaks in it, leading to the so-called ‘micropsychotic’ episodes. S Akhtar. The syndrome of identity diffusion.

Which of the following is suggestive of a ‘supportive’ technique?","options":{"A":"Confrontation","B":"Clarification","C":"Interpretation","D":"Interpretation of transference","E":"Giving advice"},"correct_answer":"E","explanation":"Dynamic (psychoanalytic) psychotherapy is often conceptualized as being on a continuum of expressive to supportive. Traditionally, psychoanalytic psychotherapy has focused on the recovery of repressed psychological material. This process has been called ‘expressive’ and is distinguished from the ‘supportive’ psychotherapies, which concentrate on supporting healthy defense (coping) mechanisms. The therapist may employ more or less expressive and supportive interventions, depending on the needs of the patient. Among the given responses in the question, advice giving leans towards the supportive end of the continuum. In addition to advice giving, other techniques usually employed that are at the supportive end of the continuum are praise, suggestions, reassurance, environmental intervention, and manipulation.

Resistance is thought of as the patient’s attempt to protect her or himself by avoiding the anticipated emotional discomfort that accompanies the emergence of conflictual, dangerous, or painful experiences, feelings, thoughts, memories, needs, and desires. Resistance occurs through the use of unconscious defense mechanisms. The recognition, clarification, and interpretation of resistance constitute important activities of the psychoanalyst and the psychoanalytic psychotherapist, both of whom must first appreciate how a patient is warding off anxiety before understanding why he or she is so compelled.

Which of the qualities shown by Nick has been shown NOT to predict good response in psychodynamic psychotherapy?","options":{"A":"Psychological mindedness","B":"Introspectiveness","C":"Acting out affects","D":"Reasonable object relationships","E":"Intense search for understanding"},"correct_answer":"C","explanation":"Most psychotherapists consider certain qualities in their patients as prerequisites for engaging in psychodynamic psychotherapy. These include psychological mindedness: curiosity about oneself and the capacity for self-scrutiny. Those who are unable to articulate and comprehend their inner thoughts and feelings cannot negotiate with the fundamental analytical words and their meanings. The inability to examine one’s own motivations and behaviors precludes benefits from the analytical method. Introspectiveness: the person should be able to experience and learn from intense affects or conflicts without acting them out. The person should be able to form reasonable object relationships, usually the capacity to form and maintain, as well as to detach from, a trusting object relationship is essential. High motivation: the patient needs a strong motivation to persevere, in light of the rigors of intense and lengthy treatment. The desire for health and self-understanding must surpass the neurotic need for unhappiness. The person should be able to tolerate frustration and therapeutic regression. Sadock BJ and Sadock VA.

According to Berne, transactions are stimuli presented by one person that evoke a corresponding response in another. Berne defined psychological ‘games’ as stereotyped and predictable transactions that people learn in childhood and continue to play throughout their lives. Strokes, the basic motivating factors of human behavior consist of specific rewards such as approval and love. All people have three ego states that exist within them: the child (the primitive element), the adult (the reality element), and the parent (an introject of the values of a person’s actual parents). The therapeutic process helps people to understand whether they are functioning in a child, adult or parent mode when interacting with others. It is thought that as patients learn to recognize characteristic games being repeated throughout life, they can ultimately function in the adult mode as much as possible in interpersonal relationships.

They often have their root in early childhood development. An example of core beliefs is ‘I’m incompetent’. These lie dormant until they are activated by certain situations (which reflect childhood events that laid down the core belief). At the next level are ‘intermediate thoughts’, which consist of rules, assumptions, and attitudes that we use to evaluate ourselves as well as other people and personal experiences. On most occasions, these rules tend to contradict the core belief (in a way reinforcing them). Examples of intermediary beliefs might be ‘I need to succeed in everything I do, in order for me to be seen as competent’. A special class of intermediary beliefs is the conditional rule, which takes the form of ‘If … then’ statements (e.g. ‘If I succeed in everything I do, only then others will consider me competent’). Automatic thoughts are cognitions that intervene between external events and a person’s emotional reaction to the event. For example, the belief that people will laugh at me when I don’t get a distinction at the exam is an automatic thought that occurs to someone who has the aforementioned ‘core belief’. Gabbard GO.

It is thought to have two forms: ‘probability TAF’ in which the intrusive thought is believed to increase the probability that a specific negative event will occur. This is prominent in those with violent obsessions. ‘Morality TAF’ in which experiencing the intrusive thoughts is morally equivalent to carrying out a prohibited action. This distortion is especially prominent in obsessions, is closely related to guilt, and is associated with subsequent attempts at neutralization. A comparable cognitive distortion termed ‘thought–shape fusion’ is thought to be present in a minority of people with eating problems and occurs when the thought of eating induces feelings of fatness, moral unacceptability, and weight gain. These cognitive distortions can be manipulated experimentally and have clinical implications that include improvement in understanding the nature of the disorder and its treatment.

When working through the exercise, the therapist asks the patient to write the thought or belief at the top of a piece of paper and then label two columns with ‘evidence for’ and ‘evidence against’ the thought. The patient is then guided to explore methodically and write down each piece of evidence. At the end of this procedure, the evidence for and against the cognition is quantified and estimated. Guided discovery is the most frequently used technique to help patients articulate automatic thoughts in sessions. The specific technique used is called Socratic questioning. One of the most powerful ways of teaching patients to detect automatic thoughts is to find a real-life example of how automatic thoughts influence their emotional responses. A shift in mood during the therapy session can be an opportune time for the therapist to facilitate the identification of automatic thoughts. The Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire devised by Hollon and Kendall is a comprehensive list of dysfunctional thoughts that has been used primarily in research studies. Similar lists can be used in clinical settings when patients are having difficulty detecting their automatic thoughts. Imagery and role-play are two methods for uncovering cognitions when direct questions are unsuccessful (or partially successful) in generating suspected automatic thinking. Gabbard GO.

From a schema-based therapy point of view, what is the underlying cognitive process that is maintaining the schema?","options":{"A":"Schema surrender","B":"Schema compensation","C":"Schema avoidance","D":"Schema utilization","E":"None of the above"},"correct_answer":"B","explanation":"Schema-based approaches in cognitive therapy are based on the original ideas of Beck. Early life experiences produce a number of thought patterns or schemata. These thought patterns are like ‘block molds’ into which thoughts fit in when evaluating events. They are otherwise called core beliefs. These result in underlying ‘assumptions’ which reinforce the core beliefs and from these arise the negative automatic thoughts. Schemata are thought to be dormant, and get activated during a depressive episode. Schemata are patterns of unconditional beliefs that are hard to access and are self-maintaining. There are thought to be three main processes that maintain schemata. Schema surrender is the process where the person seeks evidence that supports the beliefs and dismisses any evidence to the contrary. Schema compensation refers to compensating for the core belief by doing the exact opposite, but, ultimately, this action acts as a reinforcer that maintains the schema, as in the case described in the question. Ultimately, the person believes that the family loves him only because he is self-sacrificing, and if he was not, he would still remain unlovable.

The first option refers to thought–action fusion, i.e. having a thought equates to performing the action. This is consistent with the thoughts of patients with OCD, especially those who have ‘violent’ obsessions. The second statement that a person should (and can) exercise control over one’s thoughts is also consistent with thoughts in OCD. Responsibility is not attenuated by other factors (e.g. the low probability of occurrence) is a typical assumption in patients with OCD. The fourth option is also typical of an obsessive cognition. The final option is an assumption that is not typical of OCD. This is probably more typical of a depressive assumption that reinforces the core belief ‘I am a failure’. As a corollary, there may be another secondary assumption – ‘If I please everyone, I am considered successful’. Freeman C and Power M.

The program was based on the principles of learning theory, both operant theories and social learning theories, which teach parents to use positive reinforcers, like stickers, toys, or snacks to increase positive behavior, while using time out tactics to reduce negative behavior like temper tantrums. Focus is on one problem behavior at a time. The parents are taught to observe the problem behavior – the situations and timings at which it occurs. The frequency of this behavior is usually charted to look at the progress, while abstinence from the behavior is positively rewarded and indulgence in the behavior is rewarded with time outs. Parents are also taught to identify behaviors that are incompatible with the ‘problem’ behavior – e.g. talking nicely instead of whining. These are called ‘competing’ behaviors – and these are usually rewarded. Consistency in rewarding and punishing is important in this setting. This treatment is usually used in childhood disruptive disorders such as oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder. Shaping and chaining are operant techniques used to induce target behaviors. Approximating ‘da’ and ‘da’ to form the word ‘dada’ – to which the daddy hugs the child (reinforcer) is an example of shaping. Chaining is linking of more complex tasks such as wearing a pull-over shirt – this consists of a number of complex steps. Modeling is a social learning technique where a social behavior is reinforced by society. For example a student who changes dress to fit in with a certain group of students has a strong likelihood of being accepted and thus reinforced by that group"},{"question":"Which of the following is the first step in systematic desensitization?","options":{"A":"Constructing a hierarchy","B":"Relaxation training","C":"Exposure in vivo","D":"Exposure in vitro","E":"Flooding"},"correct_answer":"B","explanation":"Systematic desensitization was first developed by Joseph Wolpe in the 1950s to treat phobic patients. It is based on the principles of counter-conditioning. It attempts to replace the ‘fear’ response to phobic stimuli with a new response (muscle relaxation) that is incompatible with fear. The first step in systematic desensitization is to train the clients in deep relaxation until they can rapidly achieve muscle relaxation when instructed to do so. The second step is to construct what is known as an ‘anxiety hierarchy’, in which the client’s feared situations are ordered from the least to the most anxiety-provoking. Thus, for example, a person with phobia for ‘cockroaches’ might regard a photograph of a cockroach as only modestly threatening, but a large, rapidly moving cockroach close by as highly threatening. The client reaches a state of deep relaxation, and is then asked to imagine (or is confronted by the photograph of a cockroach) the least threatening situation in the anxiety hierarchy. The client repeatedly imagines (or is confronted by) this situation until it fails to evoke any anxiety at all, indicating that the counter-conditioning has been successful.

In this treatment, the individual is asked to masturbate regularly to their troublesome deviant fantasies, but at the point of orgasmic inevitability, to switch to a desired non-deviant fantasy. As treatment progresses, the non-deviant stimulus is introduced earlier and earlier in the arousal process until masturbation is achieved without the deviant fantasy. This technique obviously is used when the behavior or sexual preference that is of concern is not in itself dangerous or causing a public nuisance. Following the treatment, further sexual and social skills training is usually needed to ensure that the arousal to non-deviant stimuli is maintained"},{"question":"Massed negative practice treatment is used in the treatment of","options":{"A":"Tic disorder","B":"OCD","C":"Generalized anxiety disorder","D":"Panic disorder","E":"None of the above"},"correct_answer":"A","explanation":"Massed negative practice requires the individual to deliberately perform the tic accurately and with effort for a specific amount of time during the day.

Their aim is to reinforce desired behavior, while undesired behavior is extinguished or punished. In token economy, the therapist distributes so-called tokens for occurrences of desired behavior, e.g. brushing teeth or cleaning the room. These tokens are chips that function as secondary reinforcers. The patient can exchange the tokens for various objects (such as money or sweets) and favors (like watching television or taking a walk outside). This was widely used in the treatment of schizophrenia in the past, although most behavior techniques are thought to be of ethical concern. Voucher-based token economy programs are also used in substance use programs, where ‘supermarket’ vouchers worth certain amounts are given to the patient as a reward for abstinence.

They also had less impairment of social role functioning and intermediate activities of daily living. However, hypochondriacal somatic symptoms did not improve significantly. The authors of the study Barsky and Ahern explained, ‘Conceptually, hypochondriacal somatic symptoms cannot simply be stripped away with symptomatic treatment, because they exist for underlying psychological and interpersonal reasons.

NICE guidelines recommend a self-help program as a possible first step for treatment. CBT-BN, a specifically adapted form of CBT, is offered to adults with bulimia nervosa as an alternative. The course of treatment should be for 16–20 sessions over 4–5 months. When people with bulimia nervosa have not responded to or do not want CBT, other psychological treatments should be considered. Interpersonal psychotherapy should be considered as an alternative to CBT, but patients should be informed it takes 8–12 months to achieve results similar to CBT. Freeman C and Power M.

If the depression is unresponsive to the above therapies in four to six sessions a multidisciplinary review should follow. Further psychological assessment for comorbidity and further psychological and social treatments that address these should be considered. Only after these steps, is medication considered as an addition. • For young people aged 12–18 years offer fluoxetine in addition to psychological therapy. • For children aged 5–11 years cautiously consider the addition of fluoxetine (evidence for its effectiveness in this age group is not established).

Which of the following situations are possible problem areas in a case of acute depression?","options":{"A":"Role transition","B":"Grief","C":"Role dispute","D":"Interpersonal deficits","E":"All of the above"},"correct_answer":"E","explanation":"In acute treatment for depression with IPT, the problem areas can be classified as role transitions (associated with stressful life events), grief, role disputes (e.g. in marriage), or interpersonal deficits (lack of social support). Although specific stressful experiences are relevant to other IPT problem areas in the broadest sense, adjusting to stress and change in the social context requires a role transition. This might be the case in depression following the birth of a child, retirement, medical illness, divorce, etc. According to IPT, bereavement is thought to be a potential precursor of clinical depression. Development of clinical depression following a death is evidence that the normal grief process did not take place and that the individual has had an abnormal grief reaction. In such cases the work of IPT is to help the patient experience the normal grief process. A role dispute can occur in any important relationship especially the patient’s relationship with his or her spouse or significant other. In interpersonal deficits, the patient’s primary problem is seen as a paucity of social connections. Relationships buffer the individual against stressful life events and are essential to psychological well-being. As such, the primary goal is to enhance the level of social connection through concrete positive changes in the patient’s social activities (e.g. joining a club, taking a class). Attention to social support and a positive social network is also a component of work in the other IPT problem areas. Gabbard GO. Textbook of Psychotherapeutic Treatments in Psychiatry, 1st edn.

Although many depressed patients report these negative cognitions, the therapist does not systematically question and evaluate the automatic negative thoughts. Unlike cognitive therapists, interpersonal therapists neither employ thought records nor weigh the evidence to help patients re-evaluate negative cognitions. Instead, therapists shift blame to the illness, which often provides patients with an immediate feeling of relief. Therapists then capitalize on this transient mood improvement by encouraging patients to take positive steps towards resolving interpersonal problems. Gabbard GO.

Investigators randomly assigned 250 outpatients with major depression to receive 16 weeks of IPT, CBT, imipramine plus clinical management, or placebo pills plus clinical management. This study was the first comparison of IPT and CBT, each of which had demonstrated efficacy in separate trials, and the first trial to use treatment manuals and monitor the psychotherapeutic input of pharmacotherapists. Most patients completed at least 12 once-weekly treatment sessions or 15 weeks of therapy. Those with milder depression (defined as a score of <20 on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) improved equally regardless of which treatment was used. For more severely depressed patients (those with a Ham-D score of 20), imipramine worked fastest and was most consistently superior to placebo. IPT and imipramine had comparable effects on Ham-D scores and several other outcome measures, and were superior to placebo for more severely depressed patients.

It is based on Caplan’s description of four stages of coping, including emotional arousal, disorganization of behavior, trials of alternative coping and finally exhaustion and decompensation. Crisis intervention aims primarily to deal with the first stage, so that further stages can be prevented. Hence the first step is to reduce arousal, both physiological and emotional. The approach is collaborative with family and friends. Very often this stage includes the use of medications that prevent or help reduce arousal. Along with the reduction in arousal, the patient is encouraged to focus on the current problems and encourage self-help. The second stage of crisis intervention resembles problem-solving counseling and includes the assessment of patients’ problems and assets, their ability to come up with solutions and test them, and finally to consider coping mechanisms for the future if similar problems arise.

The treatment uses both behavioral and cognitive methods. It is highly structured and is manual based. Therapy is intense with individual sessions, skills training in a group and access by telephone to the therapist between sessions. It is delivered by a small team of therapists and lasts for up to a year. Individual sessions have four elements: cognitive behavioral techniques including self-monitoring; dialectical ways of thinking about problems – seeing causality in terms of both/and rather than either/or and the possibility of reconciling opposites; mindfulness, that is the practice of detachment from the experience; use of aphorisms, that is phrases that encapsulate the approach –e.g. people may not have caused the problems, but have to solve them anyway. Skills training sessions are provided in a group basis and telephone contacts are designed to help patients get out of crises, by using the skills learnt in the sessions.

This is believed to be the most important factor related to positive therapeutic effects. Group cohesion has been likened to the therapeutic alliance in dyadic treatment. In dynamic therapies, specific and non-specific elements contribute to therapeutic change. In groups, the presence of other people adds to factors present in all dyadic healing relationships. Non-specific factors are embedded in the relationships established through a consistent, accepting, non-judgmental, and supportive environment. These are all elements of a cohesive group. Groups provide a corrective emotional experience in which patients experience others (including the therapist) responding to them differently from those in their past. Members share their stories (catharsis) and feel less isolated when others have shared similar stories (universalization); they have opportunities to be helpful to others through both cognitive understanding and emotional linking (imparting information, providing feedback, and altruism). They also see others improve, which conveys hope. These elements contribute to the sense of collaboration and a willingness to adopt norms (i.e. discuss feelings about the interactions in the meeting) that further members’ sense of efficacy and belonging. They contribute to an experience of support and acceptance, which may be sufficient therapeutic gain for a number of patients. Fight/flight, pairing, and dependency are Bion’s basic group assumptions that lead to a negative therapeutic effect. Tasman A, Maj M, First MB, et al. Psychiatry, 3rd edn.

After this, the family members are asked to comment on the mother’s response. This method is called","options":{"A":"Paradoxical injunction","B":"Circular questioning","C":"Socratic questioning","D":"Role reversal","E":"Sculpting"},"correct_answer":"B","explanation":"Circular questioning is often used in family therapy as part of assessment. The purpose is to discover and clarify confused or conflicting views among the members of the family. Following this, a hypothesis is constructed about family functioning, which is then presented to the family, who should consider it between sessions. The family may be asked to try to behave in new ways. Paradoxical injunctions are used in couples therapy and family therapy. They are provocative statements designed to elicit a beneficial counter-response that the couple have previously resisted. Very often, this will include a prescription of the ‘unwanted symptom’, which the couple realize and try to give reasons why this is acceptable to the couple. Socratic questioning is a technique used in cognitive therapy. Role reversal is a technique in couples therapy which helps one partner to understand the point of view and experience of the other.

The aim of family therapy is to improve family functioning and so help the identified patient. The goals of family therapy include (1) improved communications; (2) improved autonomy for each member; (3) improved agreement about roles; (4) reduced conflict; (5) reduced distress in the member who is the patient. Family therapy developed from Ackerman’s work on psychodynamics of family and Bateson’s work on communication. Ackerman’s work led to the development of psychodynamic methods of treatment, while Bateson’s work led to the system’s approach. Minuchin developed further the system’s approach in the USA to form the structural family therapy method. Gelder M, Harrison P, and Cowen P. Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry, 5th edn.

The therapy is based on the principle that purposeful behavior activity always follows a sequence. These sequences can be faulty in three ways. Traps are repetitive cycles of behavior in which the consequence of the behavior perpetuates it. For example a depressed student is hopeless and stops studying for his exam. He fails the exam, and feels more hopeless and depressed. Dilemmas are false choices or unduly narrowed options. For example, people who fear angry feelings may think they have to choose between placation and aggression. They choose to placate others who then take advantage of them, thus making them even angrier. Snags are the anticipation of highly negative consequences of action such that the action is never carried out and therefore never subject to a reality check. Gelder M, Harrison P, and Cowen P.

This allows the therapist to formulate hypotheses and helps the client to test the validity of the hypotheses, thus actively contributing to the client’s therapy. It does not necessarily mean that the client and the therapist must agree with each other on every aspect of the therapy. In addition, the therapist need not collude with dysfunctional assumptions the client holds in order to achieve the collaboration. Sadock BJ and Sadock VA.

In this type of psychotherapy, the personality make-up, interpersonal relationships, conflicts, and emotional problems are explored by means of special ‘dramatic’ methods. Therapeutic dramatization of emotional problems includes the ‘protagonist’ or patient, the person who acts out his/her problems. The enactment is carried out with the help of ‘auxiliary egos’, people who enact varying aspects of the patient. The therapist takes up the role of the ‘director’ and guides those in the drama towards the acquisition of insight. Situations are chosen by the protagonist – this usually focuses on any special area of functioning or symptoms. The auxiliary ego takes on the role of other significant people in the protagonist’s life. The therapist directs the situations, and the group can comment on various ways in which the protagonist deals with the situation he/she is in. Techniques to advance the therapeutic process and to increase productivity and creativity include the soliloquy (a recital of overt and hidden thoughts and feelings), role reversal (the exchange of the patient’s role for the role of a significant person), the double (an auxiliary ego acting as the patient), the multiple double (several egos acting as the patient did on varying occasions), and the mirror technique (an ego imitating the patient and speaking for him or her). Other techniques include the use of hypnosis and psychoactive drugs to modify the acting behavior in various ways. Sadock BJ and Sadock VA.

Unlike those with other specific phobias who show an increase in sympathetic output on exposure to phobic stimuli, patients with blood–injury–injection phobia show a unique, biphasic response. The first phase is associated with increased heart rate and blood pressure. In the second phase, however, the blood pressure suddenly falls and the patient faints. To treat the problem, patients are shown a series of slides that are provocative (e.g. mutilated bodies). They are trained to identify early-warning signs of fainting, such as queasiness, cold sweats, or dizziness. They also learn how to apply the learned muscle tension response quickly, contingent on these warning signs. Patients can also perform applied tension while donating blood or watching a surgical operation. The technique of isometric tension raises blood pressure, which prevents fainting.

These are interventions that cover a range from one 5-minute interaction to several 45-minute sessions. The major positive studies discussed in this section typically consist of one interaction lasting between 5 and 20 minutes, sometimes with one brief follow-up contact. The acronym FRAMES stands for: feedback: about personal risk or impairment; responsibility: emphasis on personal responsibility for change; advice: to cut down or abstain if indicated because of severe dependence or harm; menu: of alternative options for changing drinking pattern and, jointly with the patient, setting a target; intermediate goals of reduction can be a start; empathic interviewing: listening reflectively without cajoling or confronting; exploring with patients the reasons for change as they see their situation; self-efficacy: an interviewing style that enhances people’s belief in their ability to change. ‘Rolling with resistance’ is a part of Miller and Rollnick’s motivational interviewing.

Stage I: In the first stage of treatment, the therapist seeks to increase behavioral control through helping patients attain basic capacities. This is targeted towards the severe ‘behavioral dyscontrol’ exhibited by the patient. Stage II: The second stage targets ‘quiet desperation’. The intent in this stage is to facilitate emotional experiencing through reducing post-traumatic stress and blocking dissociation. The principal goal of this stage is to block avoidance of emotions and the environmental cues associated with them. In this stage, patients are helped to experience their feelings without avoiding life or experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Stage III: The third stage is targeted towards ‘problematic patterns in living’. The goal of this stage is to achieve ‘ordinary happiness and unhappiness’ through increasing self-respect and working on problems with relationships and career choices. Stage IV: The fourth and final stage is directed towards ‘incompleteness’. The goal of the last stage is to develop the patient’s capacity for sustained experience of contentment, connection, and freedom. Gabbard GO.

According to NICE guidelines, what treatment is recommended?","options":{"A":"Trauma-focused CBT","B":"Single-session debriefing","C":"Wait and watch","D":"EMDR","E":"Relaxation therapy"},"correct_answer":"A","explanation":"The NICE recommends ‘Watchful waiting’ when symptoms are mild and have been present for less than 4 weeks after the trauma, with a follow-up contact within 1 month. NICE specifically asks therapists and clinicians not to routinely offer brief, single-session interventions (debriefing) that focus on the traumatic incident to that individual alone. Where symptoms are present for less than 3 months (as in the case with Rachel), NICE specifically recommends trauma-focused CBT (usually on an individual outpatient basis). Trauma-focused CBT is also recommended for people with ‘severe’ symptoms or ‘severe’ PTSD within 1 month. NICE recommends 8–12 weekly sessions of trauma-focused CBT, each session delivered by the same person and lasting around 90 minutes during which trauma is discussed. NICE advises against the use of non-directed therapies such as relaxation training. Where symptoms are milder and have lasted for more than 3 months, NICE recommends either trauma-focused CBT or EMDR.

It is usually used in combination with relaxation. This involves the recording of small changes in the physiological levels (induced by relaxation) of the feedback parameter. The display can be visual or auditory. Patients are instructed to change the levels of the physiological parameter, using the feedback from the display. It is based on the idea that the autonomic nervous system can come under voluntary control through operant conditioning. The feedback instrument used depends on the patient and the specific problem. The most effective instruments are the electromyogram (EMG), which measures the electrical potentials of muscle fibers; the electroencephalogram (EEG), which measures alpha waves that occur in relaxed states; the galvanic skin response (GSR) gauge, which shows decreased skin conductivity during a relaxed state; and the thermistor, which measures skin temperature (which drops during tension because of peripheral vasoconstriction). For example, in the treatment of bruxism, an EMG electrode is attached to the masseter muscle. The EMG emits a loud tone when the muscle is contracted and a low tone when at rest. Patients can learn to alter the tone to indicate relaxation. Patients receive feedback about the masseter muscle, the tone reinforces the learning, and the condition ameliorates.

Which of the following themes is correctly matched with the disorder?","options":{"A":"Hopelessness: panic disorder","B":"Sense of failure: agoraphobia","C":"Attentional bias towards threat: generalized anxiety disorder","D":"Black and white thinking: schizophrenia","E":"Minimization of positive appraisal: specific phobias"},"correct_answer":"C","explanation":"Clients with generalized anxiety often have an attentional bias that sensitizes them to respond to potentially threatening stimuli in the environment. Such attentional biases towards threatening information are also noted in individuals with high trait anxiety and may play an important role in the development of clinical anxiety disorders and maintenance of anxiety. Experimentally, dot probe tasks have been used to demonstrate such biases. Clients with depression often underestimate positive aspects of life, e.g. downplaying positive feedback but continuing with a sense of failure and hopelessness. They might also exhibit absolute thinking favoring negative themes – this is termed as black and white thinking.
