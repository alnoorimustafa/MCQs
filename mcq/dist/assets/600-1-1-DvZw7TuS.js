const e=JSON.parse(`[{"number":1,"question":"A 69-year-old woman presented with severe depression and short-term memory problems. Which of the following tests is most appropriate to assess her short-term memory?","options":{"A":"Copying a clock","B":"Copying pentagons","C":"Orientation to time and place","D":"Serial sevens","E":"Three-word recall"},"correct_answer":"E","explanation":"Patients with severe depression can present with significant cognitive impairment such as poor concentration and short-term memory problems. Cognitive functions can be clinically evaluated by performing an MMSE. In this test, three-word recall is used to test short-term memory. Drawing intersecting pentagons, naming, repetition, a three-stage command, reading and writing are useful for testing language. Tests of serial sevens and spelling backwards are used to evaluate attention and concentration. In addition, the MMSE includes tests for orientation to time and place. The clock-drawing test is used to screen executive functions, and visuospatial and constructional praxis. It is not a part of the MMSE, although it is usually used alongside this test."},{"number":2,"question":"Which of the following statements regarding frontal lobe dysfunction is correct?","options":{"A":"The ability to plan ahead is preserved","B":"Agnosia is a diagnostic feature","C":"Dyscalculia is often present","D":"Long-term memory loss is a consistent feature","E":"Perseveration is a sign of a frontal lobe lesion"},"correct_answer":"E","explanation":"Perseveration occurs when mental operations persist beyond the point at which they are relevant. This includes senseless repetition of words, gestures or actions. Perseveration is related to the severity of the task facing the patient. It is common in generalised and focal organic brain disorders. For a person with a frontal lobe lesion, the ability to plan ahead is impaired or lost. Other signs and symptoms of frontal lobe dysfunction include cognitive difficulties such as poor short-term memory, poor working memory and impairment of executive functions, behavioural difficulties such as utilisation, aggression, increased sexuality and emotional difficulties. Agnosia is related to receptive aphasias in which the patient experiences sensory stimuli but cannot recognise objects. Dyscalculia is a specific learning disability involving difficulties with calculations."},{"number":3,"question":"A 70-year-old man undertakes a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).

Which of the following is the most appropriate response?","options":{"A":"Attention","B":"Language","C":"Remote memory","D":"Verbal memory","E":"Working memory"},"correct_answer":"A","explanation":"The MMSE is a brief structured interview designed to assess cognitive status. It provides quantitative measurements of orientation, memory, calculations and other aspects of the systematic mental state examination. The maximum score is 30 points. The test of serial sevens tests attention and concentration. Registration and recall tests immediate and short-term memory respectively."},{"number":4,"question":"Which of the following statements regarding epileptic automatism is correct?","options":{"A":"Consciousness is preserved","B":"The control of posture is lost","C":"An epileptic automatism lasts from seconds to minutes","D":"The muscle tone is preserved","E":"The recall of events is accurate"},"correct_answer":"D","explanation":"Automatism is defined as a state that occurs during an ictal or post-ictal state and is characterised by clouding of consciousness. In this state, muscle tone and posture are preserved, though there may be limited awareness of action. It lasts from a few minutes to several hours and the individual may have little to no recollection of events. Automatism can be used as a defence in a criminal case. The legal definition of automatism is an act committed during a state of unconsciousness or grossly impaired consciousness. Such an act lacks a guilty mind. There are two types of automatisms: sane and insane. The difference between the two is based on whether the automatism or behaviour leading to the offence is likely to recur. Sane automatisms are considered singular events resulting from exogenous causes, such as confusional states, hypoglycaemia or night terrors. They lead to a full acquittal. Insane automatisms are viewed as events caused by a disease of the mind that are likely to recur. They therefore require control of the individual to ensure public safety and can lead to a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity."},{"number":5,"question":"Which of the following about Ganser's syndrome is correct?","options":{"A":"Accurate answers","B":"Amnesia of the episode","C":"Clear consciousness","D":"Orientation to time and person","E":"Rightâ€“left disorientation"},"correct_answer":"B","explanation":"Ganser's syndrome was first described in 1898 when it was identified in four criminals. It is characterised by approximate answers, clouding of consciousness, auditory or visual hallucinations, and amnesia of the episode. Perseveration, echolalia, echopraxia and hysterical paralysis may be observed. Interestingly, these symptoms are worse when the patient is being observed. It is associated with a recent history of head injury or severe emotional stress, and may be followed by depression."},{"number":6,"question":"A 21-year-old man takes a large number of paracetamol tablets with alcohol after an argument with his girlfriend.

A lesion in the left frontal lobe can result in Broca's aphasia which is characterised by reduced frequency of speech and relatively preserved comprehension. Language is reduced to a few disjointed words and the failure to construct sentences. Left temporoparietal damage results in language that is fluent although the words themselves are incorrect. This is known as Wernicke's aphasia, receptive aphasia or posterior aphasia. Dysarthria simply means disordered articulation, i.e. slurred speech. Dyslexia describes a delayed and disorganised ability to read and write."},{"number":8,"question":"Which of the following conditions is commonly associated with a catastrophic reaction?","options":{"A":"Bipolar affective disorder","B":"Borderline personality disorder","C":"Cocaine misuse","D":"Schizophrenia","E":"Vascular dementia"},"correct_answer":"E","explanation":"Initially, the term 'catastrophic reaction' was applied to a patient's performance on neuropsychological assessment. A catastrophic reaction manifests as disruptive emotional behaviour when a patient is given a difficult task. It occurs especially when a patient is unable to solve a problem. The damage to the language areas plays an important part in its aetiology. It is commonly seen in Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementias and stroke."},{"number":9,"question":"Which of the following is a test for working memory?","options":{"A":"The behavioural inattention test","B":"The Hayling and Brixton tests","C":"The token test","D":"The trail making test","E":"The zoo map"},"correct_answer":"D","explanation":"Working memory and attention can be assessed by the trail-making test. This test includes 2 parts and involves accurately joining 25 dots as fast as possible. The behavioural inattention test (BIT) is a test for detecting and measuring the severity of visual neglect, primarily in stroke and head-injured patients. It consists of six conventional tests which include star cancellation and line cancellation. It also includes nine behavioural tests. The Hayling and Brixton tests assess aspects of frontal executive functions. The Hayling sentence completion test measures the ability to inhibit a habitual or prepotent response. The Brixton test measures the ability to detect rules in sequences of stimuli and concept formation. The token test helps to measure auditory comprehension in patients with aphasia due to stroke. The zoo map is a test of planning."},{"number":10,"question":"Which of the following is a non-verbal performance component of the Wechsler adult intelligence scale (WAIS)?","options":{"A":"Arithmetic","B":"Comprehension","C":"Digit span","D":"Matrix reasoning","E":"Similarities"},"correct_answer":"D","explanation":"The Wechsler adult intelligence scale has both verbal and performance components.
