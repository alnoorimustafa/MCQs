Frontal lobe tumors are associated with symptoms suggestive of mood disturbances and psychoses, including mania and hypomania, depression, catatonia, delusions, and hallucinations. Temporal lobe tumors cause psychiatric and behavioral symptoms in as much as 50–55% of the cases. Pituitary tumors cause psychiatric manifestations in as many as 60% of cases; parietal lobe – 15%; occipital lobe – 25%; and diencephalic tumors – 50%. Kaplan HI.

Tumors of the frontal lobes tend to produce symptoms that reflect their anatomical locations. They usually interfere with frontally mediated executive functions. Tumors involving the anterior cingulate are associated with akinetic mutism. Tumors involving the dorsolateral prefrontal convexities are typically associated with apathy, abulia, lack of spontaneity, psychomotor retardation, reduced ability to plan ahead, motor impersistence, and impaired attention and concentration. Patients with orbitofrontal tumors often exhibit personality changes, irritability and mood lability, behavioral disinhibition and impulsivity, lack of insight, and poor judgment. Tumors of the ventral right frontal lobe are often associated with euphoria. Tumors of the left frontal lobe often cause decreased speech fluency and diminished verbal output, word-finding problems, and circumlocutory speech, whereas tumors affecting both frontal lobes are often associated with confabulation, Capgras’ syndrome, or reduplicative paramnesias, or a combination of these.

Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, 2004, p. 363"},{"question":"Factors affecting the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in head tumors include","options":{"A":"Site of lesion","B":"Increased intracranial pressure","C":"Rapidity of growth","D":"Histopathology of the tumor","E":"All of the above"},"correct_answer":"E","explanation":"The anatomical location of a tumor is an important factor that predicts the development of neuropsychiatric problems in the population. For example, left temporal lobe tumors are most commonly associated with psychosis. To some extent, the symptoms represent the underlying function of the involved lobe. The aggressiveness of the tumor itself and the rapidity and extent of its spread are also believed to be important factors in the type, acuity, and severity of psychiatric and behavioral symptoms that may be associated with it. Thus, rapidly growing tumors are frequently associated with more acute psychiatric symptomatology, as well as significant neurocognitive impairment. In this case, raised intracranial tension is associated with rapid growth and hence more behavioral problems. In general, the specific histological characteristics of brain tumors have not been shown to be correlated with specific psychiatric and behavioral symptoms. However, as noted previously, more aggressive tumors, such as high-grade gliomas, are more likely to be associated with acute psychiatric and behavioral symptoms than are slower growing malignant and benign tumors.

They may be spontaneous or triggered by non-emotional events. Pathological emotions have classically been explained as secondary to the bilateral interruption of descending neocortical upper motor neuron innervations of bulbar motor nuclei. Some patients with pathological emotions have bilateral lesions and pseudobulbar palsy, but others do not. Most recently, the frontopontocerebellar pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of pathological emotions. It is seen in about 15% of patients with stroke. Citalopram, as well as nortriptyline, have been found to be effective in the treatment of pathological crying after stroke in randomized placebo-controlled trials. In addition, post-stroke depression and PLAC appear to be independent phenomena, although they may coexist. Kaplan HI. Kaplan and Sadock’s Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, 8th edn.

The lifelong prevalence of all psychotic disorders among epileptic patients ranges from 7% to 12%. Patients whose epilepsy has a mediobasal temporal focus are especially at risk. Studies on the laterality of the seizure focus suggest an association of a left-sided focus with psychosis. Although conclusions derived from surface EEG recording are open to criticism, depth recordings of presurgical patients show that twice as many patients with left temporal lesions have psychosis.

Among patients presenting with self-harm, epileptic subjects are over-represented from five- to sevenfold. Risk factors for suicide in epilepsy are ranked as follows: (1) Comorbid psychiatric disorders (2) relatively young males (ages 25–49 years); (3) temporal lobe seizures (with brain lesions); (4) prolonged duration of the seizure disorder (5) inadequate therapy (6) personal, social, or occupational difficulties; and (7) availability of large amounts of antiepileptic drugs.

Typically, his seizures begin with 20 seconds of orobuccal movements followed by 40 seconds of altered consciousness. At seizure onset, Andrew feels he must constantly think of the word ‘Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious’ and repeat this several times without him being able to control it. What is this phenomenon called?","options":{"A":"Forced thinking","B":"Obsession","C":"Compulsion","D":"Forced normalization","E":"Periodic lateralization"},"correct_answer":"A","explanation":"This type of psychic aura is called ‘forced thinking,’ characterized by recurrent intrusive thoughts, ideas, or crowding of thoughts. Forced thinking must be distinguished from obsessional thoughts and compulsive urges. Epileptic patients with forced thinking experience their thoughts as stereotypical, out-of-context, brief, and irrational, but not necessarily as ego dystonic. Periodic lateralizations are recurrent EEG complexes that may be associated with prolonged confusional behavior and focal cognitive changes. Kaplan HI. Kaplan and Sadock’s Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, 8th edn. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, 2004; p. 381"},{"question":"The phenomenon where the onset of peri-ictal psychosis occurs as a result of control of epileptic seizures is called","options":{"A":"Forced normalization","B":"Forced thinking","C":"Periodic lateralization","D":"Twilight state","E":"Geschwind syndrome"},"correct_answer":"A","explanation":"Periictal psychotic symptoms more often worsen with increasing seizure activity. Rarely, psychotic symptoms alternate with seizure activity. In this ‘alternating psychosis’, as long as the patient’s seizures are not controlled, they are free of psychotic symptoms, but when they are seizure free and their EEG has ‘forced’ or ‘paradoxical normalization’, they manifest psychotic symptoms. This alternating pattern is much less common than the increased emergence of psychotic behavior with increasing seizure activity. Twilight states are episodes of confusion that may be associated with the seizure (ictal) or after a seizure (post ictal). They may be associated with odd behaviors, and the patient is usually not conscious about the behavior. Geschwind syndrome is otherwise called epileptic personality. It consists of a cluster of personality traits including hyposexuality, hypergraphia, hyperviscosity, hyperreligiosity seen in patients with long-standing epilepsy. Kaplan HI.

The International Congress of Gastroenterology has developed a standardized set of criteria for IBS. They include either abdominal pain relieved by defecation or associated with a change in frequency or consistency of stool; or disturbed defecation involving two or more of the following: altered stool frequency; altered stool form hard or loose and watery; altered stool passage straining or urgency or feeling of incomplete evacuation; passage of mucus. IBS can be categorized into diarrhea-predominant, constipation-predominant, and mixed subtypes. Medical treatment often targets the predominant symptom. IBS accounts for as much as 50% of all outpatient evaluations done by gastroenterologists. Kaplan HI. Kaplan and Sadock’s Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, 8th edn. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, 2004 p. 2115"},{"question":"Which of the following is NOT a model that has been proposed to explain the relationship between IBS and high rates of psychiatric comorbidity?","options":{"A":"Somatization disorder hypothesis","B":"Somatopsychic hypothesis","C":"Psychogenic hypothesis","D":"Self-selection hypothesis","E":"Conversion hypothesis"},"correct_answer":"E","explanation":"Studies of psychiatric comorbidity in IBS estimate rates of comorbidity at 42–64% of all IBS patients. The exact mechanism for high rates of psychiatric comorbidity in IBS is unknown. Four models have been proposed to explain the relationship between IBS and high rates of psychiatric comorbidity. The first model is the somatization disorder hypothesis. This model classifies IBS as one of a group of diagnoses that can be made from a primary somatization disorder or other somatoform disorder. The somatopsychic hypothesis states that psychological symptoms are the result of chronic gastrointestinal distress and the unsatisfactory interaction with healthcare providers who do not accurately diagnose and treat IBS. Psychogenic hypothesis states that specific psychiatric disorders cause IBS for a significant proportion of patients. Panic disorder, in particular, is proposed as a cause for secondary IBS. The self-selection model proposes that psychiatric comorbidity increases the rate of treatment seeking in patients who have IBS. Kaplan HI.

Nevertheless, psychosocial factors do play a role in the development of ulcers in susceptible individuals. Data from the National Comorbidity Survey have shown that generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is associated with an increased risk of self-reported peptic ulcer disease. Longitudinal prospective studies have shown that depression and anxiety at baseline increase the risk of ulcer development. Childhood physical abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect are also associated with a statistically increased risk of peptic ulceration in addition to other physical conditions. Acute severe stress in human beings, provoked by wars or earthquakes, can precipitate ulceration in susceptible individuals. Once formed, psychosocial factors can delay recovery and contribute to a worse prognosis. Lloyd G and Guthrie E. Handbook of Liaison Psychiatry, illustrated edition.

The prevalence of HIV dementia is around 10–15%. Cognitive changes may be directly due to the effects of HIV itself, secondary to opportunistic infection following treatment, or due to pre-existing psychological morbidity. These changes may be classified into early and late. Early symptoms consist of forgetfulness, poor concentration, balance problems, apathy, withdrawal, dysphoric mood, and dyspraxia. Symptoms that are suggestive of a late change include disorientation, confusion, peripheral neuropathies, slowed verbal responses, indifference to illness, organic psychosis, incontinence, and carphologia (picking imaginary objects and bed linen).

It is defined as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters (kg/m2). BMI values are age independent and the same for both sexes. However, BMI may not correspond to the same degree of fatness in different populations due, in part, to different body proportions. The health risks associated with increasing BMI are continuous and the interpretation of BMI grading in relation to risk may differ for different populations: underweight <18.50; normal range 18.50–24.99; overweight ≥25.00; pre-obese"},{"question":"Which of the following is considered the cardinal feature of delirium?","options":{"A":"Disturbance of sleep wake cycle","B":"Psychomotor disturbance","C":"Hallucinations","D":"Disturbance of consciousness","E":"Affective lability"},"correct_answer":"D","explanation":"The clinical presentation of delirium is defined by psychopathology and temporal course. It is usually of acute onset and the cardinal feature is a disturbance in consciousness. Impairment of consciousness is the key feature that separates delirium from most other psychiatric disorders. There is a continuum between mild impairment of consciousness and near unconsciousness. There is fluctuation in intensity, and symptoms are often worse at night. The other features are an inability to focus and maintain attention, perceptual disturbances, disorientation in time and/or space, rarely to people (though false recognition is common) and almost never to self. Disorientation to time is often the first warning sign of delirium. Attention is poor and the patient is easily distractible, looking either apathetic or intensely focused upon something. Psychomotor disturbance may be in the form of agitation or retardation. Other features may include lability of mood and incoherent speech. Gelder M, Harrison P, and Cowen P.

Up to 90% of patients have some neuropsychiatric manifestation. In most patients, CNS complications present early in the illness, and studies that have looked into it have found no relationship between systemic disease activity and neuropsychiatric manifestations. In fact, neuropsychiatric causes are second only to renal causes as far as mortality is concerned in these patients. These complications include stroke, seizures, transverse myelitis, etc. Cognitive deficits are the most common neuropsychiatric manifestation in these patients. It is present in up to 80% of the patient sample. These have been correlated with the presence of anticardiolipin antibody. In this way, most psychiatric illnesses have been correlated with the presence of an antibody in the blood. Depression has been reported in up to 40% of people with SLE. Psychiatric symptoms in SLE have been attributed to direct CNS involvement, infections, side-effects of medications, reactions to chronic illness and primary psychiatric illness. Similarly, stress has been linked to exacerbation of SLE. This is said to be mediated through the immune system. Levenson JL. Essentials of Psychosomatic Medicine, 1st edn.

In fact, Levinson says that it is not a diagnosis, but a syndrome where obsessive compulsive disorder and tics have been exacerbated in children following a group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infection. The diagnostic criteria for PANDAS that were proposed by Swedo et al. in 1998 include the following: OCD and/or chronic tic disorder (Tourette’s, chronic motor, or vocal tic disorder) that meets the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria; age at onset between 3 years and the onset of puberty; clinical course with an abrupt onset of symptoms and/or a pattern of dramatic recurrent exacerbations and remissions; temporal relation between GABHS infection and onset and/or exacerbations of clinical symptoms; and neurologic abnormalities such as motoric hyperactivity, tics, or choreiform activity during an exacerbation.

But the most commonly reported psychiatric symptoms are that of cognition, which occurs in around 45% of the patients. This can extend from mild subjective slowing to delirious and even encephalopathic states. Delirium is the most severe manifestation of hypothyroidism. Depression is the second most frequent psychiatric syndrome. Anxiety disorder is present in around 30% of the patients, and although myxedema madness ‘psychosis’ is one of the most common symptoms reported in the literature, it represents only around 5% of psychiatric morbidity in these patients.

Psychiatric symptoms are mostly affective in nature, more specifically elation. Psychosis, delirium, and anxiety have been reported. Steroid-induced psychosis may be secondary to delirium, an exacerbation of pre-existing psychosis or frank psychosis precipitated by steroids (this includes mania). The prevalence of psychiatric disturbance in patients who have been administered corticosteroids is said to be dose related. Various strategies to prevent the onset of steroid-induced psychiatric manifestations include administering the medication in divided doses, enteric coated preparations, lithium, and valproate prophylaxis for those with a previous history. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are best avoided as these have been associated with an exacerbation of symptoms. Hales RE and Yudofsky SC.

The most common cause of Cushing’s syndrome is pharmacological. Cushing’s disease is a primary pituitary tumour, which secretes an excess of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Psychiatric manifestations may be due to the direct effects of elevated corticosteroids on the neurons or due to hypothalamic dysfunction. The neocortex and hippocampus have glucocorticoid receptors, the action on which could explain the cognitive and mood disorder seen in these patients. Cushing’s disease has been associated with a reduction in hippocampal volume, which is reversed on correction of steroid levels. There is also some evidence to show that stress could be associated with exacerbation of the illness. Levenson JL. Essentials of Psychosomatic Medicine, 1st edn.

Patients with longer trinucleotide repeat lengths have an earlier age of onset and more rapid progression than those with fewer repeats. It is seen that those who inherit the disease from the paternal side have a greater number of repeats and hence show an earlier age of onset, a phenomenon called genetic anticipation. Clinically, Huntington’s disease is manifested by the triad of chorea, dementia, and psychiatric symptoms. Approximately 40% of patients exhibit major depressive disorders or meet criteria for dysthymia. Approximately 10% of patients exhibit hypomania and a few may have manic episodes. Apathy, irritability, and disinhibition may be present independent of a mood disorder. Sexual misconduct is more common, occurring in up to 20% of Huntington’s disease patients. The rate of suicide is increased up to four times in patients with Huntington’s disease. Psychiatric symptoms do not correlate with the CAG repeat length. Cummings JL. Mega M.S.

Problems with verbal memory and visuospatial function appear early in Huntington’s disease, but don’t progress as much as in patients with Alzheimer’s. The picture is typical of a subcortical dementia involving frontal subcortical circuits. Patients with Huntington’s disease show a typical loss of procedural memory. Executive function is lost early in the disease. They also show psychomotor slowing and attentional defi cits that correlate with activities of daily living (ADL). Unlike psychiatric symptoms, cognitive symptoms correlate with the number of trinucleotide repeats. Speech comprehension is maintained late into the disease well after intelligible speech production is lost. Cummings JL and Mega MS. Neuropsychiatry and Behavioural Neuroscience, 2nd edn.

Mutations in the tau gene were first found in FTD with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). Histologically FTD consists of five types. The motor neuron type with inclusions reactive for ubiquitin but not for tau is the most frequent type. The second most common is a corticobasal degeneration type that is tau positive but with ubiquitin-negative inclusions. The third is Pick’s disease with neuronal loss, widespread gliosis, and inflated neurons with inclusions positive for both tau and ubiquitin. The familial pattern has tau-positive inclusions in neurons and glial cells. Clinically frontal lobe variant accounts for the most common presentation (70%). They present with symptoms suggestive of frontal lobe dysfunction. Temporal variants are of two types: semantic and progressive aphasic. Semantic dementia accounts for about 15% of the presentation. They show progressive loss of word meaning and object or face identity. Ten percent of cases are of the progressive aphasic type"},{"question":"HIV-induced cognitive deficits have been proposed to be due to","options":{"A":"Increased calcium-induced cell injury","B":"Altered brain glucose metabolism","C":"TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis","D":"NMDA-related excitotoxicity","E":"All of the above"},"correct_answer":"E","explanation":"All of the given mechanisms have been proposed to be the aetiopathogenesis behind cognitive deficits in HIV infection. In the process of binding to a CD4+ receptor-containing cells, HIV gp120 binds to a calcium channel and increases intracellular free calcium. This also leads to an alteration in glucose metabolism, leading to brain dysfunction. Further, the viral genome is incorporated into the host genome, which leads to the release of more injurious compounds. These include substances such as quinolinic acid, superoxide anions, and other proinflammatory cytokines. These products, especially quinolinic acid, act as NMDA agonists, leading to excitotoxicity and cell death. TNF-alpha, one of the proinflammatory cytokines, is also known to trigger apoptosis or programmed cell death"},{"question":"Which of the following is the most common intracranial opportunistic infection in HIV?","options":{"A":"Toxoplasmosis","B":"Cryptococcosis","C":"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection","D":"Herpes simplex virus (HSV)","E":"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalitis"},"correct_answer":"A","explanation":"Toxoplasmosis is the most common opportunistic infection seen in AIDS patients. They may present with focal or diffuse cognitive or affective symptoms. Imaging may help with the diagnosis but may be normal in many cases. Definitive diagnosis is by biopsy. Cryptococcosis presents as meningitis with headache and fever. Other viral infections of the brain may present with personality and behavioral changes. HSV encephalitis typically presents with temporal lobe symptoms. CMV infection presents as encephalitis, retinitis, and peripheral neuropathies with demyelination. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is caused by a papova virus. The prognosis is poor"},{"question":"All of the following features of hyperactive delirium help differentiate it from hypoactive delirium, except","options":{"A":"Restlessness","B":"Hallucinations","C":"Fast EEG activity","D":"Better prognosis","E":"Increased speech"},"correct_answer":"C","explanation":"Hyperactive delirium is characterized by increased activity levels, including restlessness, loss of control of activities, and increased speed of action. Hypoactive delirium on the other hand is characterized by decreased activity levels including apathy, listlessness, and decreased speed of action. Hyperactive delirium may present with pressure of speech, altered content, and aggression, whereas hypoactive delirium usually presents with a decreased amount of speech and hypersomnolence. Hyperactive delirium is said to have a better prognosis than hypoactive delirium. But both types of delirium are characterized by diffuse slowing on the EEG"},{"question":"All of the following factors render a person at high risk for development of post-operative delirium except","options":{"A":"Baseline cognitive deficit","B":"Old age","C":"Multiple medication","D":"Emergency procedures","E":"High albumin"},"correct_answer":"E","explanation":"Along with a number of other factors, including extremes of age, pre-existing cognitive impairment, central nervous system disorders, medical comorbidity, medications, hypothermia, and electrolyte imbalance, hypoalbuminaemia is an important often unnoticed risk factor. Hypoalbuminaemia results in greater bioavailability of many drugs that use albumin as a transporter protein. This leads to greater side-effects resulting in delirium. This may not be picked up by carrying out therapeutic drug monitoring. In addition to the above, a number of surgical factors predispose to delirium, including long duration of operation, emergency procedures, and type of surgery (e.g. hip surgery)"},{"question":"Which of the following medication used in elderly people has the least propensity to induce delirium?","options":{"A":"Digoxin","B":"Prednisolone","C":"Nifedipine","D":"Cimetidine","E":"Atenolol"},"correct_answer":"E","explanation":"Atenolol is a water-soluble selective beta-blocker which has almost nil anticholinergic action. Further, due to its water-soluble property, atenolol does not cross the blood–brain barrier. All the other medications have some anticholinergic properties and may contribute to the presence of delirium, especially in older patients, who are more vulnerable and are often using multiple medications. Of these, cimetidine and prednisolone are particularly important"},{"question":"All of the following are causes of diffuse slowing on EEG except","options":{"A":"Alcohol withdrawal delirium","B":"Post-traumatic delirium","C":"Anticholinergic delirium","D":"Hepatic encephalopathy delirium","E":"Hypoxic delirium"},"correct_answer":"A","explanation":"Alcohol withdrawal delirium and benzodiazepine intoxication delirium present with low-voltage fast-activity on EEG. All the other options present with diffuse slowing, which is the pattern seen in most other cases. Frontocentral spikes are usually seen in toxic delirium, i.e. usually due to hypnosedative withdrawal or TCA and phenothiazine intoxication. Epileptiform activity may suggest post-ictal states or non-convulsive status epilepticus"},{"question":"In children with PANDAS, which symptoms are least common?","options":{"A":"Obsessions","B":"Emotional lability","C":"Tics","D":"Separation anxiety","E":"Auditory hallucinations"},"correct_answer":"E","explanation":"Motoric hyperactivity, impulsivity, night-time difficulties, distractibility and inattention, emotional lability, some degree of anorexia, and separation anxiety are some of the behavioral symptoms reported in association with PANDAS. From the choices available, it appears auditory hallucinations would be the least common symptom. Two antibodies have been found to be suggestive of PANDAS, D8/17 and anti-basal ganglia antibody. Both are not specific for PANDAS. Rising antistreptolysin O (ASO) or anti-DNAse B titres are suggestive of recent GABHS infection"},{"question":"Which is the most common site for the primary tumour in a metastatic brain cancer?","options":{"A":"Lung","B":"Breast","C":"Kidney","D":"Gastrointestinal tract (GIT)","E":"Prostate"},"correct_answer":"A","explanation":"Of patients with intracerebral metastases, 40% originate in the lung, 20% are from breast tumours, 10% are melanomas, 7% arise from the genitourinary tract, 7% from the GIT, and 5% are of gynaecological origin"},{"question":"A 40-year-old lady with multiple sclerosis (MS) was diagnosed with depression. She is on a number of medications for her MS. Of the following medication she is on, which is most likely to be associated with depressive symptoms?","options":{"A":"Gabapentin","B":"Amantadine","C":"Baclofen","D":"Interferon 1-beta","E":"None of the above"},"correct_answer":"D","explanation":"All of the present neuromedical treatments for MS including, corticosteroids, beta-interferons, glatiramer acetate, and immunosuppressants, are suspected to affect mood, at least in some individuals. Corticosteroids are associated with euphoria initially and long-term intake could lead to a depressive state. Initial studies of interferon beta-1b, an immunomodulatory cytokine used to reduce MS disease activity over prolonged periods, found increases in depression following initiation of treatment, and increased risk of suicide attempts. More recent studies have shown that this association may not be as robust as it was thought before. In fact, at least one study has shown that baseline depression levels actually drop following treatment with the medication. It is now thought that baseline or previous history of depression is more likely to predict the development of depressive symptoms during treatment"},{"question":"John is a 30-year-old man being treated for psychotic depression with selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and antipsychotics. He takes an overdose of his medications and is admitted to the medical unit with features of tremor and hyperthermia. He does not know which medications he has taken. Which of the following points to a diagnosis of serotonin syndrome rather than neuroleptic malignant syndrome?","options":{"A":"Myoclonus","B":"‘Lead-pipe’ muscle rigidity","C":"Rhabdomyolysis","D":"Elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK)","E":"Delirium"},"correct_answer":"A","explanation":"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome occurs in the setting of antipsychotic use or the sudden withdrawal of dopaminergic drugs and is characterized by ‘lead-pipe‘ muscle rigidity, extrapyramidal side-effects, autonomic dysregulation, and hyperthermia. This disorder appears to be caused by the inhibition of central dopamine receptors in the hypothalamus, which results in increased heat generation and decreased heat dissipation. The serotonin syndrome, seen with SSRIs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and other serotonergic medications, has many overlapping features, including hyperthermia, but may be distinguished by the presence of diarrhea, tremor, and myoclonus rather than the lead-pipe rigidity of neuroleptic malignant syndrome"},{"question":"James was admitted to the medical unit following an attempt of deliberate self-harm (DSH). What percentage of people completes suicide within a year of the DSH attempt?","options":{"A":"1%","B":"10%","C":"20%","D":"30%","E":"40%"},"correct_answer":"A","explanation":"There is a clear link between DSH attempt and suicide, with 15–25% of those who die by suicide having presented with an episode of DSH in the year prior to their death. Between one-third and two-thirds of those who commit suicide having a lifetime history of DSH"},{"question":"Which is the antipsychotic of choice for a 75-year-old man with Parkinson’s disease who presented with psychotic symptoms?","options":{"A":"Aripiprazole","B":"Risperidone","C":"Olanzapine","D":"Quetiapine","E":"Haloperidol"},"correct_answer":"D","explanation":"The American guidelines recommend the use of Clozapine or Quetiapine for the management of psychosis in Parkinson’s disease. The guidelines also note that Olanzapine should not be used for the same. With few exceptions, all atypical antipsychotics have comparable efficacy against psychosis and the choice is mainly based on their ease of use and the side-effect profile. Risperidone and olanzapine are associated with sedation. Risperidone can cause considerable worsening of parkinsonism. Olanzapine has been known to worsen cognition and hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes. A recent Committee on Safety of Medicines warning suggests an increased risk of strokes associated with the use of risperidone and olanzapine in old people. Clozapine has the best evidence for use in Parkinson’s as this was the first atypical antipsychotic that came on the market. However, due to the tedious monitoring protocols, it is seldom used in the population, and it has a restricted license in the UK. Quetiapine is favored by many psychiatrists because of its better side-effect profile and being as efficacious as Clozapine, at least in one study. Aripiprazole has been shown to worsen Parkinson’s disease"},{"question":"If a patient continues to take sodium valproate throughout her pregnancy what is the risk of the baby having a neural tube defect?","options":{"A":"0.05–0.1%","B":"1–2%","C":"10–20%","D":"20–30%","E":"30–40%"},"correct_answer":"B","explanation":"Sodium valproate is considered a human teratogen. Although several studies have shown rates of neural tube defect of up to 10%, the risk is generally considered between 1% and 2%. The effect of the drug on neural tube development is related to its use 17–30 days post conception, and the risk is dose related. The neural tube defect found in exposed infants is more likely to be lumbosacral rather than anencephalic, which suggests a drug effect on neural crest closure"},{"question":"Which of the following is NOT a feature of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?","options":{"A":"Late insomnia","B":"Severe unexplained fatigue not resolved by rest","C":"Duration more than 6 months","D":"Post-exertional malaise","E":"Muscle aches and pains"},"correct_answer":"A","explanation":"The Center for Disease Control definition of CFS (also called neurasthenia and myalgic encephalitis in the UK) consists of severe unexplained fatigue for over 6 months. This is of new or definite onset; not due to continuing exertion; not resolved by rest; and is functionally impairing. The criterion also mentions other symptoms that are suggestive of CFS, out of which at least four need to be present for the diagnosis"},{"question":"Which antidepressant has got good evidence for its use in post-myocardial infarction depression?","options":{"A":"Fluoxetine","B":"Citalopram","C":"Reboxetine","D":"Mirtazapine","E":"Sertraline"},"correct_answer":"E","explanation":"Two large, multicentre trials were designed to assess the safety, efficacy, and consequence of treating depression in patients with cardiovascular disease. The first, Sertraline Treatment of Major Depression in Patients with Acute MI or Unstable Angina (SADHART) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 40 medical centres. The primary objective of SADHART was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sertraline treatment for major depressive disorder in patients hospitalized for acute MI or unstable angina without other life-threatening medical complications"},{"question":"Which of the following is the treatment of choice for premenstrual dysphoric disorder?","options":{"A":"SSRI","B":"Primrose oil","C":"Vitamin E","D":"Vitamin A","E":"St John’s Wort"},"correct_answer":"A","explanation":"The term premenstrual syndrome (PMS) was first coined by a physician from England named Katharina Dalton in 1953; however, premenstrual tension was a term used prior to this. More than 150 different symptoms have been attributed to PMS, but the one unifying concept is that these symptoms must occur during the (late) luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, causing significant impairment in a woman’s functioning, and must disappear within the first few days of menses"},{"question":"Mothers with anorexia nervosa are at high risk for having babies with","options":{"A":"Greater congenital malformations","B":"Larger birth weight","C":"Are born post term","D":"Macrocephaly","E":"Lower birth weight"},"correct_answer":"E","explanation":"The evidence here is limited and sometimes conflicting. Overall it seems that a current eating disorder, particularly active anorexia nervosa, carries an excess small risk to the mother and the fetus"},{"question":"The percentage of people with mental illness who were in contact with psychiatric services within 1 week of suicide is","options":{"A":"10%","B":"20%","C":"30%","D":"40%","E":"50%"},"correct_answer":"E","explanation":"Much of what we know about suicide in the UK psychiatric population is based on data collected by the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness. They are a relatively morbid group – more than half of patients had a secondary psychiatric diagnosis, and 16% of patients had been admitted to a psychiatric bed on more than five occasions"},{"question":"Which of the following is the best screening tool used in post-natal depression?","options":{"A":"Hamilton depression rating scale","B":"Edinburgh postnatal depression scale","C":"Montgomery Asberg depression rating scale","D":"Hospital anxiety and depression scale","E":"Beck’s depression inventory"},"correct_answer":"B","explanation":"Common somatic complaints of pregnancy may be misconstrued as symptoms of depression when using traditional depression assessment scales (such as the Beck Depression Inventory, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, or the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), symptoms of depression reported by pregnant women may be misidentified as normal pregnancy-related complaints by treating obstetricians"},{"question":"Which of the following is least associated with suicide?","options":{"A":"Depression","B":"Mania","C":"Schizophrenia","D":"Anxiety disorder","E":"Dementia"},"correct_answer":"E","explanation":"Suicide rates are increased in all psychiatric disorders, except dementia. Most estimates of the lifetime suicide rate in schizophrenia are in the region of 5% to 10%, slightly less than in major affective disorders"},{"question":"Maria suffered from postpartum blues during the immediate postpartum period, what is the chance that she develops postpartum depression?","options":{"A":"1–5%","B":"10–15%","C":"20–25%","D":"30–35%","E":"40–45%"},"correct_answer":"C","explanation":"The most common constellation of mood symptoms experienced by women in the immediate postpartum period is typically referred to as the postpartum blues or baby blues. A relatively common phenomenon (occurring in 50–80% of women), postpartum blues include transient symptoms and rapid mood shifts, including tearfulness, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, lack of energy, loss of appetite, and the general experience of feeling overwhelmed particularly with regard to newborn care-giving tasks"}]');export{e as default};
