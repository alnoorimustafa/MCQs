    "question": "A 55-year-old man with chronic schizophrenia resists any passive limb movements attempted during a neurological examination, in spite of being asked not to do so. Which of the following symptom is he exhibiting?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Obstruction",
      "B": "Negativism",
      "C": "Automatic obedience",
      "D": "Waxy flexibility",
      "E": "Ambitendency"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient is exhibiting a catatonic symptom called negativism. Patients with negativism resist or oppose all passive movements attempted by the examiner. A mild form of such resistance is called Gegenhalten or opposition. In extreme forms it is called negativism, where apparently motiveless resistance to all interference is found. Negativism can be a frustrating symptom, especially for carers involved in offering nursing assistance to the patient. The catatonic symptom of blocking or obstruction (or Sperrung) refers to a phenomenon similar to thought blocking but occurs while carrying out motor acts. A patient with obstruction suddenly stops a motor act for no reason, without any warning. This may be demonstrated by asking the patient to move a part of his body; the movement is generally well begun, but then stops halfway without any indication. In ambitendency the patient makes a series of tentative, opposing, alternate movements that do not reach the intended goal. This becomes evident when the patient is asked to carry out a motor act, for example asking the patient to show his tongue will elicit repeated protrusion and retraction of tongue as if the patient is undecided about showing his tongue.

      "D": "Reasoning",
      "E": "Common sense"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "While humor may facilitate the process of clinical interview on certain occasions, it is not a necessary component of descriptive psychopathology. There are two essential components of descriptive psychopathology: (1) the observation of behavior; and (2) the empathic assessment of subjective experience. The latter was referred to by Jaspers as phenomenology and implies that the patient is able to introspect and describe his internal experiences and the doctor recognizes and understands the description. To describe a phenomenon, it is important to appreciate the phenomenon from the beholder’s point of view. This attempt to ‘feel like how your patient might feel’ is very different from feeling sorry or pity for your patient. The former is called empathy while the latter is called sympathy. Empathy is an essential component to learn further about the pathological processes taking place in a patient. Sims A. Symptom in the Mind, 3rd edn. London: Elsevier Science, 2003, pp. 5, 10"

      "A": "Form provides sufficient information for management",
      "B": "Form provides sufficient information for severity",
      "C": "Form is more important than content",
      "D": "Form provides sufficient information for diagnosis",
      "E": "Content is more important than form"
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The patient usually presents with loss or impairment of functions, the reasons for which will reveal the contents of the patient’s thoughts and feelings. Form is the technical term (e.g. phobia, obsession, or delusion) used to identify a recurring pattern of experience or behavior and so helps in diagnosing the psychiatric disorder. Content is essential for decisions about the management of the patient and family (suicidal content, admission, etc.), and is an important aspect of the severity of the disorder. A symptom described using descriptive psychopathology has both form and content as equally important components. The same content can occur in different forms, for example the content ‘I’m too fat’ can occur as an obsession, delusion, overvalued idea, or even hallucination. Sims A. Symptom in the Mind, 3rd edn.

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Stimulus may be perceived as corresponding object but not as accurate as the real object. This is a perceptual error (sensory distortion), and can be associated with changes in physical properties, for example size, shape, intensity, and color. In depression and hypoactive delirium there is dulled perception. Intense perceptions can occur in mania, hyperactive delirium, and drug-induced states (hallucinogens).

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "A perceptual error associated with changes in shape of objects, especially with loss of symmetry, is called dysmegalopsia. The objects can shrink in size (micropsia) or enlarge (macropsia). These are usually organic and could be related to ictal (parietal) or ocular pathology (accommodation errors – paralysed accommodation can cause micropsia). They are also rarely seen in acute schizophrenia. Hallucinogens (e.g. mescaline) can also change the color of perceived objects or make components of an object (e.g. body parts) be seen detached in space. Sims A. Symptom in the Mind, 3rd edn.

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Imagery is not a perception because there is no stimulus involved and no object perceived; it is essentially a fantasy. Imagery refers to images produced voluntarily with complete insight that they are a mental phenomena and not of external origin.

      "D": "Affect illusion",
      "E": "Hallucination"
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "There are three major types of illusions: in affect illusion the prevailing emotional state leads to misperceptions, for example a depressed patient reading ‘deed’ as ‘dead’, a boy frightened of the dark seeing monsters from innocuous shadows. Pareidolia refers to perceiving formed objects from ambiguous stimuli, for example seeing cars in the clouds. It is common in delirium, especially in children. They are often playful – not characteristic of any psychotic illness. Completion illusion is due to inattention; stimulus that does not form a complete object might be perceived to be complete, for example CCOK is read as COOK. Eidetic imagery is considered to be a special ability of memory wherein visual images are drawn from memory accurately, at will and described as if being perceived currently. This is not a perceptual distortion but closely linked to mental imagery and it is often noted in children. Sims A. Symptom in the Mind, 3rd edn. London: Elsevier Science, 2003, p. 97"

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Pareidolia refers to perceiving formed objects from ambiguous stimuli, for example seeing faces in a fire or hidden messages when records are played in reverse. It is coloured by prevailing emotion and not entirely due to inattention or affective change; fantasy and imagery play a part in addition to actual sense perception. On paying extra effort the object intensifies and does not disappear. Pareidolia is common in febrile delirium, especially in children, and also in hallucinogen use. They are under voluntary control and often playful. Occurrence of pareidolia is not characteristic of any psychotic illness. Sims A. Symptom in the Mind, 3rd edn.

      "D": "True hallucinations are sought in other modalities by the patient",
      "E": "True hallucinations cannot occur in two modalities simultaneously"
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Hallucinations have several important qualities which are essential in differentiating them from other mental phenomena. Hallucinations take place at the same time and in the same space as other perceptions, for example ‘an angel is standing in the corner of my room’. This is different from fantasy or imagery which takes place in a subjective space. They are experienced as sensations – not as thoughts – in contrast to obsessional images. The percept has all the qualities of a real world object, that is a patient when hallucinating believes that the percept can be experienced in other modalities too, like a real object which can be seen, felt, smelt, and heard. Pseudohallucinations are defined variously. The term is used to describe hallucination-like experiences with retained insight (so it is not sought in other modalities of perception). It is also used to describe hallucination-like experiences that take place in a subjective space, for example ‘a voice inside my head’. Sims A. Symptom in the Mind, 3rd edn.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Elementary hallucinations are unstructured hallucinations that are seen in acute organic states. They are composed of sounds or flashes without being fully formed. Elementary hallucinations can precede development of fully formed hallucinations, especially in alcoholic hallucinosis. The flashes of lights are also called phosphenes. Words such as ‘go’ are meaningful and so cannot be a part of elementary hallucination. Sims A. Symptom in the Mind, 3rd edn. London: Elsevier Science, 2003, p. 100"

    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Phonemes are any auditory hallucinations that occur as human voices. Schizophrenic phonemes are usually multiple voices. The voices may or may not be recognizable. These voices are usually male with a different accent but speaking in one’s mother tongue. Schizophrenic hallucinations are usually episodic – almost never continuous.

    "explanation": "Elderly patients having normal consciousness and no brain pathology but with reduced visual acuity due to ocular problems experience vivid, distinct, usually well-colored hallucinations. This is known by the eponym Charles Bonnet syndrome. Paradoxically these perceptions are clear and colorful in contrast to real sensation, which is blurred due to eye disease. These hallucinations are mostly in the form of humans, or at times animals and cartoons. These objects usually show movement, and can be voluntarily controlled to an extent as they disappear on closing the eyes. Insight about unreality is usually preserved – though they may evoke emotions, including fear and joy. About one-third of Charles Bonnet hallucinations are elementary, unformed hallucinations. Usually these hallucinations are located in external space. Sims A. Symptom in the Mind, 3rd edn. London: Elsevier Science, 2003, p. 104"

    "explanation": "Lilliputian hallucinations can occur in visual or haptic mode – they usually involve seeing tiny people or animals (or feeling diminutive insects crawling if haptic) and are seen in delirium tremens. Unlike other organic visual hallucinations, lilliputian hallucinations can be accompanied by pleasure (though this is often intermingled with terror). These are not the same as micropsia. Micropsia is a perceptual distortion but not a hallucination as there is a stimulus which is perceived to be erroneously small. Perception of small objects in the absence of such stimuli is a lilliputian hallucination. Sims A. Symptom in the Mind, 3rd edn. London: Elsevier Science, 2003, p. 105"

    "explanation": "Palinopsia (palin for ‘again’ and opsia for ‘seeing’). is a visual disturbance that causes images to persist even after their corresponding stimulus has ceased. It is seen in LSD use, migraine, occipital epilepsy, and head trauma. It is similar to afterimage but color inversion (usually shadows or distorted colors) noted in afterimages is conspicuously absent. Formication (formic acid – from ants) is a special type of haptic hallucination.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Autoscopic hallucinations are the visual experience of seeing oneself. It is seen predominantly in males compared to females at a ratio of 2:1. Impaired consciousness is a common accompaniment and depression is the commonest psychiatric cause of autoscopy. They are also called phantom mirror images and may take the form of pseudohallucinations. Schizophrenia (where autoscopic experience is usually pseudohallucinatory), TLE, and parietal lesions (organic states more likely to have true hallucinations) are also implicated.

    "explanation": "In functional hallucinations an external stimulus provokes a hallucination, and both hallucination and stimulus are in same modality but individually perceived, for example voices heard simultaneously whenever the noise of water running through a kitchen tap is heard. They are not illusions, as the stimulus is perceived appropriately (noise of water), but in addition there is another perception (voices) without an appropriate object. If hallucinations in one modality are provoked reflexively by stimulus in another modality, for example seeing an angel whenever listening to music, then this is called reflex hallucination. The phenomenon of perceiving a stimulus of one modality in a different modality (may be single or multiple modalities) is called synaesthesia, for example tasting the music, hearing colours, and smelling voices.

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The pathology of thought can be divided into content (What is being ‘thought about’?), form (In what manner (or shape) is the thought present?), and stream or flow (How is it being thought about?). Disordered thought content is seen as delusions, for example persecutory themes, obsessions, or preoccupations. Overvalued idea is also a disorder of thought content. Disordered stream of thought is seen as poverty of thought, pressure of speech, and crowding of thoughts. Disordered form of thought, as seen in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, refers to a set of various alterations in the thinking process – loosening of associations, metonyms, tangentiality, and circumstantiality to name a few. As an analogy, ‘thought’ can be considered to be a box of packed fruits bought in the supermarket. Form is equivalent to the shape of the box (e.g. rectangular plastic box), content is equivalent to the type of fruit (e.g. oranges or peaches) and stream is equivalent to the number of fruits in the box (e.g. 6 or 12).

If the action has been carried out, then the patient admits to ownership of the act, not the impulse behind it) Three thought phenomena: (experiences themselves are more important than later explanations of how a patient interprets them) Thought withdrawal Thought insertion (external agency inserting thoughts into the patient) Thought broadcast (also called thought diffusion – as if in a television broadcast, everyone comes to know about the patient’s thinking as and when the patient thinks – refers to loss of privacy of thoughts. Contrast with referential delusion – ‘people act as if they know what I am thinking’) Two isolated symptoms: Delusional perception Experience of sensations on the body caused by external agency (somatic passivity) Somatic hallucinations are NOT first rank symptoms unless there is a delusional elaboration and attribution of the origin of sensations to an external agency (passivity).

These symptoms are not comprehensive features of schizophrenia; they are clearly identifiable, frequently occurring, and occur more often in schizophrenia than any other disorder. First-rank symptoms emphasize form rather than content, for example the fact that one’s thoughts are heard as echo of voices is more important than the actual content of the voices; this increases cross-cultural reliability, although variations exist.

Often both of these are true – primary delusions are not only irreducible but also precede other mental phenomena.

An old lady comes to clinic with a match box of skin scrapings, as evidence for the parasite that infests her, causing itching. This can predate the onset of dementia. It may or may not be associated with a somatic tactile hallucination. It is not the same as compulsive skin picking, where the psychopathology is one of compulsion and not delusion. In factitious dermatitis, patients seek medical attention without obvious monetary gain in order to be in a patient role.

Metonyms are word approximations, for example paperskate for pen. Stock words are either newly synthesized or already known words but used in an idiosyncratic way repeatedly, often with many meanings and in different contexts, sometimes dominating a discourse, as in this example.

It is seen in some patients with temporal lobe epilepsy or alcohol-induced persisting dementia, learning difficulty, and in obsessional personalities. It is a formal thought disorder where figure ground differentiation apparently fails. It is not due to affective changes such as mania. It is not the same as tangentiality – the patient never reaches the point in tangentiality, whereas they do reach the point in circumstantiality. Imagine a spiral that eventually touches its centre, while tangent scrapes through the edge and never reaches the centre. Circumstantiality may be related to loosened associations and usually develops within the setting of a delusional mood in schizophrenia; it may be due to an impairment of a central filtering process that normally inhibits external sensations and internal thoughts that are irrelevant to a given focus of attention.

    "explanation": "Schizophrenic thought disorder could be measured using repertory grids (Bannister) based on Kelly’s personal construct theory. The patient is asked to score different elements (can be relatives or friends) under different constructs (qualities of them). Normally, one would expect congruence between different constructs scored for an element, for example Mum is helpful and she is also kind and supportive. But in schizophrenia the predictability of an element’s quality using prior constructs is affected. (Mum is helpful but scores low on kindness and support offered). This is called serial invalidation and is more pronounced for peoples than objects, showing that thought disorder affects interpersonal realm more than other spheres. The scores can be used to draw a semantic space, demonstrating graphical connections between people and qualities in a patient’s personal world. Sims A. Symptom in the Mind, 3rd edn.

    },
    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "All of these stated methods have been employed to quantify formal thought disorder seen in schizophrenia. Word association tests are abnormal in schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia prefer dominant meaning of a word, despite the context of its usage, for example court means ‘law-room’ not tennis court, in spite of a discussion about sports. This abnormality can be tested using word association tests. In cloze procedure parts of one’s recorded speech are deleted to see if meaning could be still predicted; predictability was reduced in the speech of patients with schizophrenia. Type–token ratio refers to the ratio between the number of different words used during a discourse and the total number of spoken words. Impoverished vocabulary was noted with low type–token ratio among schizophrenia patients. Cohesion analysis refers to the analysis of links between sentences and words in a discourse. It shows that schizophrenia patients use less referential ties (e.g. using pronouns without mentioning a subject in first place) and more lexical ties (i.e. connected words). Sims A.

    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Insight is a multidimensional concept; it is not useful to restrict oneself to the assessment of ‘presence’ or ‘absence’ of insight. Though traditionally insight was considered to be present in those with neurosis and absent in those with psychosis, this is now regarded as too simplistic. Insight is now recognized to exist in a spectrum of varying degrees. David (1990) has considered insight to be composed of an awareness of one’s own mental experiences, ability to recognize abnormal experiences as pathological, and compliance with treatment interventions. Insight is closely related to the neurological symptom of anosognosia. A patient who is suffering from a hemiplegia refuses to accept that he has lost the function of his limb.

    "explanation": "Depersonalization is the third most common symptom that is seen in patients attending psychiatric clinics. It is defined as a change in self awareness where the individual feels as if he is unreal. The ‘as if’ quality differentiates it from psychotic states. When a similar feeling occurs for objects and environment around an individual, it is termed as derealization (Mapother). It is always subjective, unpleasant, and invariably associated with affective change but preserved insight. Emotional numbing, loss of feelings of agency and self esteem, disturbed body image, altered perception of time, and disturbed sensory experiences of all modalities are reported. Sims A.

    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The patient described here most probably suffers from depression with difficulty in expressing her feelings to others. Inability to verbally express emotional states (alexithymia) can partially explain symptoms of somatization occurring secondary to depression. In somatization disorder, recurrent, multiple, frequently changing somatic complaints are present for several years; this is not the case with the patient described in this question. Pathological changes in right cerebral hemisphere projections and failed thalamic feedback are also suggested but not proved as possible explanations for somatizing. It is suggested that the patients with first-rank symptoms of psychosis have difficulties in differentiating the ‘source’ of their experiences.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Pathological gambling is defined as persistent, recurrent and problematic gambling behaviour associated with a preoccupation to gamble and spending increasing amounts of money in gambling. Patients often show a loss of control over gambling and pursue gambling at considerable expense of other activities of daily living. It is best regarded as an impulse control disorder together with kleptomania, intermittent explosive disorder and pyromania, etc. The gambling behaviour must not be directly due to manic episodes in order to be diagnosed as pathological gambling. It is not an overvalued idea; it is an abnormal behaviour and not merely an aberration of thought content. Pathological gambling is not an essential feature of antisocial personality.

    "explanation": "In catatonic mutism comprehension is preserved and the patient may obey commands. It can range from full mutism to partial states where the patient mumbles and makes non-verbal vocalizations. Patients can move their vocalizing muscles – hence they can cough and clear their throats. Other catatonic signs are ambitendency (patient appears stuck in indecisive, hesitant movements), automatic obedience (exaggerated cooperation with examiner’s request or incessant continuation of requested movement), and echopraxia/ echolalia (mimicking examiner’s movements/ speech) etc. Sims A.

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Hallucinations are not always pathological. Any normal person can experience hallucinations, for example hypnagogic hallucinations and hallucinations during bereavement. Even patients with very low IQ can experience these perceptual disturbances, as perception requires a lower-level cognitive processing.

      "E": "Subvocal motor activation"
    },
    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "An exaggeration of self-serving attribution bias is seen in psychosis. Patients excessively attribute hypothetical, positive events to internal causes (stable and global – grandiose) and hypothetical, negative events to external causes (stable and global – persecutory). When deluded patients were shown a sequence of black and white beads and were asked to decide which jar the sequence was probably drawn from (jar A had majority of black beads and B had majority of white), they came to a conclusion with far fewer beads in a given sequence than controls. They were also relatively overconfident about the accuracy of their judgement. This is hypothesized to be due to impaired probabilistic reasoning (the ability to generate hypothesis and test statistical probability). But later studies showed that when allowed to see as many beads as the controls, patients reached similar, correct conclusions – they were able to generate hypothesis and test the probability; the defect being deficient data gathering (less information before decision). This is called jumping-to-conclusion style of reasoning (JTC). Persecutory delusions reflect false beliefs about the intentions and behaviour of others that could arise from theory of mind deficits.

It is a wildly ataxic, staggering gait accompanied by gross, irregular, jerky truncal movements, and thrashing and waving arm movements. Patients with the symptoms rarely experience a fall; even if they do, they do not get seriously injured. Posturing is maintaining an uncomfortable posture for a long time. Negativism is motiveless resistance to all movements; catatonia can also present itself as mitgehen – patient bends his limb even with a gentle finger push from the examiner like an ‘angle poise lamp’.

    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "In neurological spasticity the tone is increased irrespective of passive or active movements. A patient with catatonia can use the affected limb or muscle group when needed with completely normal tone – for example running out when there is a fire. Negativistic phenomena, for example gegenhalten and mitgehen, are often distinguishing features of catatonia. Gegenhalten refers to the phenomenon where the patient resists movement of his or her extremities by the examiner. Mitgehen is said to be present when the patient moves in the direction of a slight push from the examiner in spite of the command to remain still. Catatonia persists in sleep and can continue for weeks without improvement. Catatonia is mostly seen in advanced primary mood or psychotic illnesses. Among inpatients with catatonic presentation, 25 to 50% are related to mood disorders and approximately 10% are associated with schizophrenia. Sims A. Symptom in the Mind, 3rd edn.

In depression anhedonia is more physical – not able to enjoy listening to music, not able to enjoy going for walks, etc. In schizophrenia it is thought to be more social – that is not able to enjoy other’s company, not feeling warm in personal relationships, etc. A longitudinal study by Blanchard et al. (2001) compared depressed patients and schizophrenia patients on a measure of social anhedonia; recovered depressed patients showed significantly less social anhedonia than schizophrenia patients on follow-up after 1 year. This suggests that anhedonia in depression is more of a state than a trait characteristic while it may be a trait characteristic in schizophrenia. Joiner TE, et al.

    "explanation": "Wernicke’s aphasia is also called jargon aphasia. Here the comprehension of a patient is limited but motor production is more or less preserved. This leads to error-prone language similar to the incoherence noted in schizophrenic speech disturbances. In Broca’s aphasia the patient cannot produce fluent language although his comprehension is preserved. Alexia is inability to read words while agraphia is inability to write. Although schizophrenic speech disturbances can be deciphered from one’s writing, this does not equate to having agraphia.

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Paranoia is a loosely used term. Paranoia literally means ‘beside the mind’. Paranoid delusions include any self-referential delusions such as referential delusions, persecutory delusions, grandiose delusions, hypochondriacal delusions, and nihilistic delusions. Some bizarre delusions are not self-referential and are not classified as paranoid delusions, as in this question. Sims A. Symptom in the Mind, 3rd edn. London: Elsevier Science, 2003, p. 144"

    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Catastrophic reaction is seen in demented patients who are asked to perform a task that is clearly beyond their cognitive capacity. They may become anxious, agitated, and angry. This is not a universal phenomenon. This occurs in some patients even if they do not have explicit awareness of their cognitive impairment. Tiberti C et al. Prevalence and correlates of the catastrophic reaction in Alzheimer’s disease. Neurology 1998; 50: 546–548"

    "question": "A 23-year-old man points to his left elbow and says he could hear voices coming from it. Which of the following symptoms is he exhibiting?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Anosognosia",
      "B": "Somatic hallucination",
      "C": "Extracampine hallucination",
      "D": "Auditory hallucination",
      "E": "Somatization"
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "In this example, the best description for the patient’s symptom of hearing voices is auditory hallucination. It cannot be somatic hallucination where touch sensations are involved. Abnormal bodily sensations called as ‘cenesthesias’ are well associated with psychopathological symptoms in schizophrenia. ‘Cenesthopathic schizophrenia’ is included but undefined within the category ‘other schizophrenia’ (F20.8) in the ICD-10 classification. Anosognosia refers to lack of awareness of having neurological deficits akin to loss of insight in schizophrenia. It is not somatization as this example describes a psychotic symptom. It is not extracampine as the patient’s sensory field contains the source of the voice, that is his elbow is within the reach of his eyesight and auditory field. Jenkins G and Röhricht F. From cenesthesias to cenesthopathic schizophrenia: a historical and phenomenological review. Psychopathology 2007; 40: 5, 361"

      "C": "Hallucinations",
      "D": "Depersonalization",
      "E": "Amnesia"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Most psychopathological symptoms are noticeable in so-called normal population in the absence of diagnosable mental conditions. For example hypnagogic hallucinations are very common. Depersonalization can occur during fatigue in normal persons. Obsessions are noted in a child’s developmental period even in the absence of any pathological processes. Amnesia is also common in the general population. But delusions are almost always pathological. It is argued that beliefs exist in a dimension from normalcy through overvalued ideas up to delusions. Even if this is true, when delusions are identified clinically, they almost always mean a pathological process. Sims A. Symptom in the Mind, 3rd edn. London: Elsevier Science, 2003, p. 117–148"

    "question": "When a patient is asked where she is living, she says ‘Helltown’ instead of ‘Hilton’. She quickly corrects her error after saying the word. This is an example of which of the following phenomena?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Parapraxis",
      "B": "Confabulation",
      "C": "Pseudologia fantastica",
      "D": "Manipulation",
      "E": "Impulsivity"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "A parapraxis is an unintentional act that is explained in psychoanalytic terms as perfectly motivated but unconsciously determined failures of ego defence. According to Freud, parapraxes include failures of memory, slips of the tongue, mistaken identity or activities, etc. Confabulation refers to filling memory gaps in patients with organic memory difficulties such as Korsakoff’s syndrome or dementia. A confabulating patient makes no attempt to correct the validity of his statement. In pseudologia fantastica, seen in Munchausen’s syndrome and histrionic personality, ‘fantastic’ fluent lies are told without full awareness of their implications. Berman D. Deliberate parapraxes. International Review of Psycho-analysis 1988; 15: 381–384"

      "C": "Pseudobulbar dysarthria",
      "D": "Autism",
      "E": "Mania"
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "In pronominal reversal a subject reverses the usage of the pronouns ‘I’ and ‘you’. The patient may say ‘You want a biscuit’ when in fact she/ he wants a biscuit. This is seen in autistic children. This is more or less characteristic and not seen in other psychiatric illnesses as often as in autism. In conduction aphasia, repetition is affected while motor production of speech and comprehension are preserved. Pronominal reversal is not a part of schizophrenic speech disturbances or manic thought disorders. Lee A. I, you, me, and autism: An experimental study.

      "C": "Catalepsy",
      "D": "Twirling",
      "E": "Twisting"
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Twirling is often noted in children with autism. The repetitive behaviours often seen in autism include hand flapping, finger flicking, rocking, jumping, and head banging. Repetitive use of a particular object or a part of the object is often observed in people at the lower functioning end of the autistic spectrum and in children rather than adults with autism. This is not a catatonic phenomenon. Bodfish JW, et al Varieties of repetitive behaviour in autism; comparison to mental retardation. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders 2000; 30: 237–243"
