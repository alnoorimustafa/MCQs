    "question": "The majority of postpartum psychotic episodes are characterized by which of the following presentations?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Schizophreniform presentation",
      "B": "Affective–manic presentation",
      "C": "Delirium–organic presentation",
      "D": "Dissociative presentation",
      "E": "Catatonic presentation"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "It is well known that postpartum psychosis is often an episode of bipolar manic illness. A small minority have a schizophreniform presentation or organic, delirious presentation. Another episode of relapse occurs in the same year in nearly 70% of cases, and the risk during subsequent pregnancies is greater than 50%. In delirious presentations, ruling out organic causes, such as postpartum pituitary apoplexy, is very important. Sadock BJ and Sadock VA.

    "explanation": "Postpartum psychosis affects 1 to 2 per 1000 childbirths. Initially, it was claimed that the incidence was higher in the West, but currently, comparable rates have been obtained worldwide. In contrast, postpartum depression affects 10 to 15% of all mothers, while postpartum blues affects 50 to 70% of mothers. Sadock BJ and Sadock VA.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Time of onset of symptoms is an important clue in postpartum illnesses, especially to aid diagnosis during early presentation. Postpartum blues typically start 3 to 5 days after delivery; postpartum psychosis is also of acute onset and can develop between 2 weeks and 2 months after delivery; postpartum depression can occur anytime between 2 months and 1 year after childbirth, most commonly in the third month.

    "question": "Which of the following principles has guided the organization of disorders in ICD-10 Chapter V?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hierarchy",
      "B": "Reversibility",
      "C": "Treatment response",
      "D": "Mode of onset",
      "E": "Degree of disability"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Jasperian hierarchy refers to the principle that, in psychiatric practice, some diagnoses when made preclude using another diagnostic label even if a second diagnosis could account for a constellation of symptoms. For example, when a diagnosis of major depression is made, symptoms of generalized anxiety are included in the description of depression itself; a separate diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder need not be entertained. Similarly, depressive symptoms can be present during an acute psychotic episode of schizophrenia – they need not always indicate a separate diagnosis of depression. The hierarchy is maintained in ICD-10, to some extent, in the way the various chapters of ICD are organized. Organic disorders trump a diagnosis of psychotic disorders, which in turn are more or less equally considered with affective disorders. Affective disorders trump neuroses, which in turn trump personality disorders. DSM has abandoned this hierarchy to a large extent, though the principle is retained. Different modes of onset or degrees of disability will not yield differing diagnoses. Treatment response cannot be considered as a principle for organization of ICD-10 Chapter V.

      "D": "Stress disorders",
      "E": "Personality disorders"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Schizoaffective disorder is a diagnosis that lies between schizophrenia and affective disorder. It is placed together with schizophrenia in section F20–29. ICD-10 stipulates that schizophrenic and affective symptoms must be simultaneously present and both must be equally prominent. In DSM-IV, the concept of a continuum between psychosis and affective illness is better highlighted. According to DSM-IV: (1) both schizophrenia and affective disorder categories must be met simultaneously; (2) a period of psychosis (2 weeks) without prominent affective symptoms must be present; and (3) the mood disturbance must be present for a substantial period during active (psychotic) and residual periods. Note that in postschizophrenic depression (classified under schizophrenia in ICD-10) the psychotic symptoms must not be prominent (but residual) when a depressive episode is present, and depression must be within 12 months of the most recent psychotic episode. Schizophreniform disorder is a diagnosis used when schizophrenia does not fulfill the duration criteria in DSM-IV (<6 months). This diagnosis is not included in ICD-10. World Health Organization.

    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "In general, both DSM and ICD use symptom count, age of onset, duration, impairment, and exclusion criteria for many psychiatric diagnoses. Aetiological information and theoretical speculations are avoided in classification. Course specifiers are used often in DSM-IV to aid in subtyping a disorder. Good or poor prognostic typology is not employed as a classification principle in either of these systems. Semple DM et al., eds. Oxford Handbook of Psychiatry, 1st edn.

      "D": "Length of illness is a criteria for diagnosing DSM-IV schizophrenia",
      "E": "Schizotypal disorder is a personality disorder in ICD-10"
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "In DSM-IV, a period of at least 6 months of observation is required before a reliable diagnosis of schizophrenia could be made. In ICD-10, a period of 1 month is used instead. This makes DSM-IV schizophrenia narrower than ICD-10 schizophrenia. Schizotypal disorder is a personality disorder according to DSM-IV, not ICD-10. Culture-bound syndromes are separately coded in DSM, which is largely an American system. ICD-10 encompasses cultural differences in various places throughout the text. World Health Organization.

Personality difficulties or learning difficulties; can include defence mechanism/ coping strategy employed predominantly Axis 3. General medical condition (may or may not be related to Axis 1 or 2) Axis 4. Psychosocial stressor (both positive and negative) Axis 5.

      "D": "Specificity of checklist",
      "E": "None of the above"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Reliability of a test refers to its ability to produce the same results when tested at different times (test–retest reliability) or tested by different observers at the same time (observer reliability). Validity refers to the ability of a test to measure what it sets out or intends to measure. Sensitivity refers to the ability of a test to pick the highest number of true patients from a sample to whom it is administered. Specificity refers to the ability to identify the correct diagnosis among various different possibilities. Reliability of diagnostic classifications is enhanced by using operationalized check lists. Field trials enhance the validity. Reliability and validity need not always correlate. It is possible for many clinicians to make the same diagnosis which is not really right (reliable but invalid). Validity has a ceiling set by reliability – very low reliability can reduce validity though vice versa is not true. Johnstone EC et al., eds. Companion to Psychiatric Studies, 7th edn.

      "D": "Cross-sectional studies",

    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "How can we know whether the diagnosis we make using a set of descriptions and observation is the true condition that a patient has? Cross-sectional studies of even a huge number of patients cannot answer this question. Longitudinal study of the patient in question can improve claims about a diagnosis – but classification systems are typically constructed to enable a clinician to make a diagnosis after a time-sliced, cross-sectional interview rather than a lifelong observation. We can ensure that everyone makes the same diagnosis by having a consensus statement or cross-cultural studies. Definite laboratory measures that are objective can, if developed, increase the validity of a diagnosis. Johnstone EC et al., eds. Companion to Psychiatric Studies, 7th edn.

      "C": "Prognostic information",
      "D": "Informs qualitative research",
      "E": "All of the above"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Categorical classification refers to the current ICD-10 and DSM-IV approach of using mutually exclusive labels for diagnosis in an ‘all or none’ fashion. A diagnosis is either present or absent according to this system, very similar to the medical model – pneumonia is either present or absent. Relative advantages of a categorical system are (1) it is very familiar and not complex to construct; (2) it is easy to remember and communicate; and (3) it informs management decisions readily (e.g. if there is malaria, give chloroquine). A dimensional approach considers a continuum of diagnostic issues; it uses degrees of severity of a particular dimension (say mood, anxiety) rather than mutually exclusive ‘boxes’ of diagnosis. In this way various dimensions can be employed simultaneously to describe a patient’s difficulties. Relative advantages of a dimensional system include: (1) more information is conveyed and this may include valuable information of prognostic importance that can be missed using plain categories; (2) it is very flexible; (3) it does not impose strict, artificial boundaries between disorders and so has better validity; and (4) it is more holistic and less labelling, thus informing qualitative research.

      "C": "Developmental disorders",
      "D": "Affective disorders",
      "E": "Cognitive disorders"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "It has been argued that personality disorders are better considered in a continuum with normalcy and so a dimensional approach is tipped for personality disorders in future DSM classifications. Note that contemporary cognitive psychologists consider delusions to exist in a continuum of normal beliefs and so a modular approach is criticized. But this does not imply that delusional disorders, as defined currently, exist in such a continuum. Johnstone EC et al., eds. Companion to Psychiatric Studies, 7th edn.

    "explanation": "Dementia is an organic syndrome wherein progressive, global cognitive disturbance is noted. Dementia is often irreversible. Cognitive disturbances include memory difficulties (amnesia), aphasia, agnosia, apraxia, impaired executive function, and personality changes. Significant psychosocial impairment must be present to warrant a diagnosis of dementia. Clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, wide diurnal fluctuation, presence of autonomic signs, and a high degree of reversibility on treating the potential cause are other differentiating features that point towards delirium.

    "explanation": "Smoking is a risk factor for dementia especially of the vascular type, though controversies exist as to whether smoking could prevent Alzheimer’s disease. A large survey of UK male doctors followed up from 1951 has demonstrated that smoking in fact increases the risk of Alzheimer’s. Also in a prospective, population-based cohort study of 6868 participants >55 years followed up for an average of 7 years, smoking was associated with increased risk of any dementia in general, and Alzheimer’s in particular"

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Evidence for dementia preventive strategies has emerged recently though this is largely concerned with delaying the onset rather than abolishing the risk. Sustained use of NSAIDs is associated with a reduced risk of developing AD. Some NSAIDs appear to modulate the amyloid load in the brain. But NSAIDs have significant adverse effects that might limit their potential as primary preventive agents in AD. Oestrogens and HRT cannot be recommended and the potential of statins remains to be fully assessed. Evidence for using antioxidant supplements such as vitamin E and vitamin C is far from clear cut and there are safety concerns about higher doses of vitamin E. Strategies to target mid-life vascular risk factors are likely to have an important effect on the age of presentation of AD, though as of now none of the given options are recommended to prevent dementia"

      "D": "APOE4 allele",
      "E": "Defective tau protein"
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Of patients with Alzheimer’s, 40% have a positive family history of Alzheimer’s. This is especially true if the patient is younger (<55). Among various genes implicated, Chromosome 21 carries the gene for amyloid precursor protein (APP) which when mutant increases amyloid deposition even before senility, so it is associated with younger-onset dementia. Trisomy 21 acts via the same mechanism in Down’s. The APO gene on chromosome 19 codes for apolipoprotein (apo). People with one copy of the APOE4 allele have Alzheimer’s three times more frequently than do those with no APOE4 allele, and people with two APOE4 alleles have the disease eight times more frequently. Diagnostic testing for APOE4 is not recommended because it is seen in more patients without Alzheimer’s than those with the disease and so accounts only for 50% of genetic variance. E3 is the most common APOE allele and E2 may be protective. It is possible that apoE4 mediates Alzheimer’s risk via lipid metabolism as the presence of apoE4 increases cholesterol levels in blood. Chromosome 14 (presenilin 1) and chromosome 1 (presenilin 2) are also implicated in early-onset Alzheimer’s via increased beta amyloid deposition"

    "explanation": "The term operational definition refers to a definition that is specified by a series of precise, unambiguous inclusion and exclusion criteria. In other words, an operational definition is arrived at by using a checklist. This improves the reliability of a classificatory system tremendously. Before the popular use of ICD and DSM systems, the cross-national agreement for psychiatric diagnosis was very poor, as exemplified by the US–UK diagnostic study. In the UK, the rate of manic depression was ten times higher and the rate of schizophrenia was two times lower than the prevalence in the US (Cooper, 1972). Operational definitions paved the way for the wider use of standardized diagnostic instruments, increasing the reliability of classification"

Prions are virus-like transmissible agents but without any nucleic acid. They are simple, mutated proteins originating from the normal human prion protein gene (PRNP), which is located on the short arm of chromosome 20. When mutant PrPSc is formed it is partially protease-resistant with a capacity to change further normal PrP to PrPSc, initiating a cascade. CJD presents non-specifically with fatigue and flu-like symptoms with rapid development of neurological findings such as aphasia, cerebellar signs, myoclonus, apraxia with emotional lability, depression, delusions, hallucinations, or marked personality changes.

    "question": "A 40-year-old man develops irritability and depressed mood with significant personality change. His father committed suicide at age of 45 and grandmother suffered from memory problems before she died at age 57. Which is the most important diagnosis to consider in this case?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Parkinson’s disease",
      "B": "Wilson’s disease",
      "C": "Huntington’s disease",
      "D": "Sydenham’s chorea",
      "E": "Fahr’s disease"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The clues in this case are young age of onset, presence of irritability, and personality change with family history including a degree of ‘anticipation’ over generations. Premature death, suicide, and psychiatric problems point to Huntington’s disease in family members. The onset is usually during the fourth decade with significant numbers showing juvenile presentation with successive generations. The course is almost always a deteriorating pattern with death occurring around 10–12 years after diagnosis. Fahr’s disease refers to idiopathic bilateral basal ganglia calcification.

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "In alcoholic hallucinosis, psychotic symptoms start either during intoxication or withdrawal, but in a clear sensorium. The most common symptoms are auditory hallucinations; these are usually unstructured voices which can develop into persecutory or derogatory content. The hallucinations usually last for a short period and any persistence beyond 6 months is a strong suspicion for other psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia. Sadock BJ and Sadock VA.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Narrowed repertoire of drinking was included as one of the criteria for alcohol dependence by Griffith Edwards and Milton Gross in 1976. Heavy drinkers may have a wide drinking repertoire. This narrows as dependence advances. The dependent person may start to drink in a restricted pattern and manner every day, which would ensure a constant blood-alcohol level avoiding any symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. This is different from salience wherein priority is given to alcohol over other important areas of life and even painful consequences are disregarded. Gelder MG et al., eds.

    "explanation": "The peak ages of onset are 10 to 25 years for men and 25 to 35 years for women. Age of onset of schizophrenia is quoted as a supporting feature of neurodevelopmental hypothesis. A substantial reorganization of cortical connections, involving a programmed synaptic pruning, takes place during adolescence in humans. An excessive pruning of the prefrontal synapses, perhaps involving the excitatory glutamatergic inputs to pyramidal neurones, may underlie schizophrenia. This is called the Feinberg hypothesis.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Stereotyped and recurrent pulling of hair with exacerbations during times of stress is characteristic of an impulse control disorder called trichotillomania. Similar to other impulse control disorders such as kleptomania, there is a sense of relief associated with the act. This commonly involves the scalp, facial hair, or axillary hair. The prognosis in children is better than adults; the latter often show a chronic fluctuating course. Some patients may bite the pulled hair, and complications such as intestinal obstruction can occur, especially in children.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "There is a strong correlation between low IQ and incidence of schizophrenia. Traditionally, male and female incidences were thought to be equal but this has been recently challenged. McGrath undertook an exhaustive review of the literature on incidence rates and concluded that distribution of rates was significantly higher in males compared to females; the median male/female rate ratio was 1.40 in this analysis. Another meta-analysis, looking at 20 year’s data on patients under 64, concluded similarly. Note that prevalence of schizophrenia does not differ between sexes.

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Though schizophrenia is equally prevalent in men and women, differences exist in the onset and course of illness. Onset and age at first hospitalization are earlier in men; women display a bimodal age distribution, with a second peak occurring in middle age. It is observed that men are more likely to be impaired by negative symptoms and women are more likely to have better premorbid adjustment. The outcome for female schizophrenia patients is better than that for male schizophrenia patients; currently it is unclear whether this could be attributed to later age of onset in females.

    "explanation": "The prevalence of schizophrenia in general population is around 1%. The prevalence rate increases when considering non-twin siblings of schizophrenia patients (8%). The risk is further elevated to 12% for a child born to a mother or father with schizophrenia. The risk shoots to 40% if both parents have schizophrenia, while having a monozygotic twin with schizophrenia increases the risk to 47% for the second twin. In dizygotic twins the risk is similar to that for a non-twin sibling, that is 12%. Sadock BJ and Sadock VA.

It occurs in 1 per 4000 live births; spontaneous deletion of chromosome 22q11.2 is responsible in most cases. It is characterised by mental retardation, facial dysmorphic features, cardiac anomalies, and neuroendocrine abnormalities, such as absent parathyroid, maldeveloped thymus, etc. It is thought to be related to problems in neural crest cell migration. Interestingly, the recent discovery of COMT polymorphism to be located at the same chromosomal loci adds to the speculation that psychosis is linked to this chromosome.

    "explanation": "The patient described in this question achieves sexual arousal by cross-dressing and retains heterosexual relationships. He is exhibiting fetishistic transvestism, a paraphilia or disorder of sexual preference. A patient with gender identity disorder will have dysphoria for biologically assigned gender (most often male sex) and will strongly prefer to change his appearance to that of opposite sex, through hormonal treatment or corrective surgeries. Sexual dysfunction of arousal phase refers to sexual aversion or lack of interest in having sexual intercourse. The scenario does not reflect the person’s sexual orientation.

    "explanation": "The disorganised or hebephrenic schizophrenia is characterized by significant disruption in behaviour with some disinhibition. It characteristically has an earlier onset – around adolescence. These patients have pronounced formal thought disturbances, often with inappropriate emotional responses and incongruity of expression. In negative schizophrenia a deficit state starts without any positive psychotic symptoms. Residual schizophrenia is characterized by a history of florid positive symptoms in the past with current presentation suggestive of a negative syndrome.

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Cannabis intoxication can alter perceptual accuracy; colours may seem brighter with subjective slowing of the time. Depersonalization and derealization could occur. Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder is rare; transient paranoid ideation is more common. Hemp insanity refers to transient psychosis associated with heavy use of very potent cannabis. This is very rare and does not mimic schizophrenia in its course. It is generally believed that earlier onset of heavy potent cannabis use for a long duration can result in schizophrenia, at least in a group of genetically predisposed individuals. Cannabis can induce a sense of euphoria and relaxation, prompting self medication in patients with established schizophrenia. Gelder MG et al., eds. New Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Post schizophrenic depression is recognized in ICD-10 as a major depressive episode which starts within 12 months of the most recent psychotic episode; while residual psychotic symptoms can be present they must not be prominent. It is noted that such patients are likely to have had poor premorbid adjustment, schizoid traits, and more insidious onset of their psychotic symptoms. Family history of a mood disorder can increase the likelihood of developing post schizophrenic depression. It may be associated with a less-favourable prognosis, higher relapse, and a higher rate of suicide. DSM-IV TR considers postschizophrenic depression only as a research category.

    "explanation": "In its natural course untreated depression lasts for 6 months while untreated mania lasts for about 4 months. So it is important that the therapy continues throughout this period as an absolute minimum. A manic episode by definition must meet a duration criteria of at least 1 week, or less if a patient must be hospitalized. A hypomanic episode must last at least 4 days. It is thought that as time goes, the intervals between episodes shorten, and the episodes themselves increase in duration. In a lifetime, patients with bipolar illness can have more than 10 episodes (both mania and depression) with duration and interepisodic interval stabilizing after the fourth or fifth episode.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Hypercortisolaemia is seen in nearly 50% of those with major depression. This is evident by measuring excretion of urinary-free cortisol or salivary cortisol. It is posited that the normal feedback inhibition of ACTH and CRH by cortisol is disturbed due to abnormal glucocorticoid receptors, leading to high persistent cortisol levels. Dexamethasone administration (DST) fails to stimulate the feedback loop and so fails to suppress the cortisol level. This is one of the most consistent and robust findings in depression. But it is not specific to depression – it is also noted to some extent in mania, schizophrenia, dementia, and other psychiatric disorders. Sadock BJ and Sadock VA.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Life events are strong predictors of onset of depression. It is suggested that the association of life events and depression is stronger for the first episode than recurrences of depression. This may be because a kindling effect underlies depression. In other words, depression begets depression once the initial damage is done by a life event. It is not necessary that life events must precede the onset of depression in every patient.

    "explanation": "In DSM-IV rapid cycling disorder is a course specifier while ICD-10 does not include this as a separate category or specifier. It can occur in both bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorders. Rapid cycling is diagnosed if there are at least four episodes fulfilling the criteria of major depression, mania, hypomania, or mixed mood disorder in the previous 12 months. Hypothyroidism is associated with rapid cycling bipolar disorder. Other causes of rapid cycling in a bipolar patient include the use of antidepressants that can induce switching, excessive use of stimulants including caffeine, non-compliance with medications, and presence of temporal lobe arrythmias in EEG.

Also remember that any patient with elation and psychosocial impairment that necessitates hospitalization is diagnosed to have mania and not hypomania according to DSM-IV, irrespective of the duration criteria. In the absence of psychotic symptoms or hospitalization, clinical features must last for at least 7 days before a manic episode can be diagnosed. Johnstone EC et al., eds.

      "E": "History of cannabis use"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Delusions of all types can present in bipolar disorder, as they do in schizophrenia. Family history of affective disorders is not uncommon in patients with schizophrenia, invalidating this aspect as a strong feature to differentiate the two major psychoses. Cannabis use and religious hallucinations can also occur in bipolar disorder. Ever since Kraeplinian concept of dementia praecox was introduced, one reasonable, though not always reliable, feature that differentiates these two illnesses is the absence of interepisodic residual symptoms in bipolar disorder. In the majority of patients with schizophrenia significant impairment is noted even between full-blown psychotic episodes. But note that residual cognitive impairment is increasingly noted in euthymic bipolar patients. Gelder MG et al., eds. New Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry. Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 568"

      "E": "Rapid cycling is more common in men"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Bipolar disorder has no gender variation in prevalence rates. Unipolar depressive disorder is more common in women of all ages compared to men. The only time in life where the incidence is equal or slightly higher in males is when depression is prepubertal, and this is rare. The gender gap narrows with advancing age and in geriatric population the incidence rates across the genders are very much closer than in early adult life.

    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Bipolar is the most heritable of all psychiatric disorders. Apart from being a risk factor for the development of bipolar disorder, a family history of bipolar disorder increases the risk for any mood disorders. Overall, in families of patients with bipolar illness, unipolar depression is the most common expressed phenotype. Note that a significant proportion of these unipolar patients can later get a revised diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Thus the mood disorders do not breed true on their own. The heritability of schizophrenia is around 50–60%. Conduct disorders and alcoholism have lower heritability rates than the psychoses. Sadock BJ and Sadock VA.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Double depression refers to an episode of major depression in a patient with dysthymia. Dysthymic disorder is distinguished from major depressive disorder using both severity and duration criteria. Dysthymic patients complain that they have always been depressed since childhood or adolescence. A patient with dysthymia is prone to get recurrent depression, and major depression of various severities can occur on top of dysthymia, leading to double depression. It is estimated that nearly 40% of patients with major depression actually have a double depression. The prognosis may be poor in double depression. Sadock BJ and Sadock VA.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Patients with obsessions usually harbour their difficulties for a long time (often 5 to 10 years) before they present to a doctor. The ego-dystonic nature of obsessions results in anxiety and reduces help seeking and sharing of their secret illness. OCD has its origin in adolescence or childhood. But most patients do not seek help until they are in their twenties or thirties. Often the onset of depression brings OCD to clinical attention. Gelder MG et al., eds.

But the useful pointers are: (1) ego-dystonic nature of obsessions may not be prominent in psychosis; (2) insight that the thoughts are one’s own may not be seen in psychosis; (3) resistance to the obsessions may be conspicuously absent; and (4) content of obsessions may be bizarre, instead of the usual themes of safety, contamination, sex, violence, religion, etc. Gelder MG et al., eds.

    "explanation": "Night terror is a sleep disorder seen mostly in children. It is a disturbance of slow wave non-REM sleep. Generally in NREM sleep, dreams cannot be fully recollected. When a patient wakes up from NREM sleep, he is often confused. A night terror is a dramatic episode where the patient screams, has autonomic arousal, appears confused but goes back to sleep without clear memory of the arousal the next morning. Though this is fairly common in children around age 7, a new onset sleep terror in adults should prompt neurological investigations to rule out epilepsy or brain damage.

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Panic attacks have an autonomic arousal component with sweating, palpitation, trembling or shaking, shortness of breath or smothering, feeling of choking, nausea, and dizziness. A cognitive component is characterized by fear of going mad, losing control, fear of dying, derealization and depersonalization. The most characteristic type of panic attack is the spontaneous (out of the blue) episode. Situational panic attacks occur when exposed to or anticipating an exposure to a particular situation. Occasionally, some individuals have panic attacks in certain situations sometimes but not always – these are called situationally predisposed panic attacks. Nocturnal panic attacks are common in patients with panic disorder. They are similar to panic attacks that occur in daytime. Isolated, nocturnal panic attacks are rare and must prompt investigations to rule out medical causes. Especially in case of non-fearful panic attacks where cognitive components are absent, one should suspect medical causes. There is nothing called unilateral panic attack! Gelder MG et al., eds.

    "explanation": "Most patients with schizophrenia who commit suicide are in an acute phase of psychosis, have a history of previous attempts, achieve poor symptom control, have a high degree of comorbidity, and show greater non-compliance. For several decades, the literature has quoted the lifetime risk of suicide in schizophrenia as 10–15% (from Miles et al. who examined mortality reports published between 1931 and 1975, and estimated the lifetime risk to be 10%). This figure was subsequently challenged by Inskip et al. who analyzed 29 studies using proportionate mortality (the percentage of the dead who died by suicide) and estimated the risk to be substantially lower at 4%. A recent meta-analysis by Palmer et al., using more rigorous methods, has concluded that the rate of suicide in schizophrenia is around 5.6%. Palmer BA, Pankratz VS, and Bostwick JM.

McGrath and colleagues have recently challenged this figure. Compiling data from nearly 200 studies that reported on the epidemiology of schizophrenia, they estimated the mean lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia (the proportion of individuals in the population who have ever manifested the illness and who are alive on a given day) as 4 per 1000.

    "explanation": "Narcolepsy is characterized by irresistible attacks of sleep together with cataplexy (brief episodes of sudden bilateral loss of muscle tone, often in association with intense emotion) and recurrent hypnapompic or hypnagogic hallucinations or sleep paralysis at the beginning or end of a sleep episode. Characteristically, the EEG shows REM pattern during hypnagogic or hypnapompic hallucinations and sleep paralysis. The narcoleptic sleep is usually a refreshing (REM) sleep. Sleep onset REM is characteristic. Strong genetic association with HLA-DR2 locus is noted, with an autosomal dominant inheritance. HLA-DR2 is found in 90 to 100% of patients with narcolepsy. It is also shown that patients with narcolepsy are deficient in the neurotransmitter hypocretin (also called orexin) associated with hypothalamic modulation of appetite and alertness. EEG is normal between narcoleptic attacks. Sadock BJ and Sadock VA. Kaplan & Sadock’s Synopsis of Psychiatry: Behavioral Sciences/Clinical Psychiatry, 10th edn.

    "explanation": "Both mania and depression are characterized by various neurovegetative signs – disturbances in sleep, appetite, weight, energy levels, and circadian functions. In depression early morning awakening is characteristic. To qualify as early morning awakening, a patient must wake up at least 2 hours prior to his usual waking time. In mania, there is increased energy associated with reduced need for sleep. Patients can go on for many days with barely any sleep. Paradoxically, sleep deprivation itself can induce a state similar to hypomania in some susceptible individuals. World Health Organization.

Presence of previous history of depression; clearly observable depressed mood; biological symptoms of depression; voluntary complaints about memory failure (patients with dementia tend not to realize their own memory problems); indifference and ‘I don’t know’ answers when formally testing memory (while confabulation may be seen in dementia); and response to antidepressant medication (unusual in true dementia) are some clues to pseudodementia. In cognitive tests, visuospatial and executive functions can be impaired in dementia but such impairment is highly unlikely to be due to isolated depression. Neurological signs, including frontal release, points towards dementia. Sadock BJ and Sadock VA. Kaplan & Sadock’s Synopsis of Psychiatry: Behavioral Sciences/Clinical Psychiatry, 10th edn.

The patient cannot recall important personal information that occurs when the alternate personality is in control (one-way amnesia). The personality states are also called alters. Often alters are widely different in their perception, relation, and adaptation to the environment and self.

    },
    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Dissociative fugue is characterized by sudden, unexpected but purposeful travel away from one’s routine dwelling, associated with amnesia for strikingly significant periods of the past. This may be associated with assumption of a new identity. Though this can occur in depression, it is more often seen as stress-induced dissociation state. Depersonalization is not a characteristic accompaniment. Family history of epilepsy in a patient with fugue state must prompt investigations for TLE. Usually, patients with fugue have no anterograde amnesia or attention difficulties and have apparently good self-care and social interaction. World Health Organization.

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "There are important conceptual differences between somatization disorder and hypochondriasis. In hypochondriasis the patient dreads the presence of an undiagnosed disorder. He seeks diagnosis more than treatment. The patient asks for various unwarranted diagnostic tests but will not be satisfied by any negative results. A patient with somatization is not concerned about diagnosis as much as she is concerned about symptom relief and intervention. Various sophisticated diagnostic measures are not sought usually. Instead, various treatments may be tried by both patients and health-care professionals. World Health Organization.

These symptoms often resolve on their own (relapsing–remitting course). For example, as in this case, bladder dysfunction and limb weakness. Conversion disorder also presents with neurological dysfunction (often ‘loss of function’ as opposed to somatoform disorder where there is a ‘positive’ symptom such as pain) which can resolve on its own, on resolution of a conflict.

    "explanation": "This is a difficult question; questions of this type are best answered at their face value, with only the given information and without making any further assumptions. Patient A has obsessional symptoms with no other pathology highlighted. As such, the risk of suicide is low in OCD without depression. Patient C has the risk factor of alcohol use, but the rest of the history (female, young, sought help, impulsive) suggests low risk. Patients D and E seem to have no suicidal intention.
