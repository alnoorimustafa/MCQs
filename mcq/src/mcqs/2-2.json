    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The incidence of a disease is defined as the number of ‘new’ cases diagnosed in a specified time interval for a specified size of population at risk. The midinterval population usually determines this population size. For example while calculating the incidence of a disease in 1 year, the comparison is made against the midyear population. Number of newly diagnosed cases in 2008 Incidence in 2008 = Mid 2008 population in an area Incidence is a rate ratio, that is it is measured against time. It is not a mere number and it is usually expressed per 100 000 persons in a population, per year. The essential criterion is that the measure should indicate all new occurrences of a disease within the period of observation in an area, irrespective of whether the newly diagnosed patients are cured or dead within the period of observation itself. For an accurate measurement of incidence, two cross-sectional surveys must be carried out in the same population; one must be at the beginning of a defined period and the other at the end of the same period.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Lifetime prevalence is the proportion of individuals in the population who have ever manifested a disorder, who are alive on a given day. This is ascertained by surveying a population cross-sectionally and finding out if they ever satisfied the criteria for a disorder in the past or at the present time. As one can observe, although this method is commonly used in epidemiological surveys, it is prone to recall bias. Lifetime morbid risk refers to risk of contracting a disease for each individual in a birth cohort if they live long enough to reach the average life expectancy of the population. This must be clearly differentiated from prevalence estimates. Prevalence is largely a population measure, while lifetime morbid risk is more close to an individual’s chances of being diagnosed with an illness. Saha S, Chant D, Welham J, and McGrath J.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Incidence is a ratio between the number of newly diagnosed cases within a specified time period in a population and the total number of people living in the area (total population). To be accurate, such comparisons must exclude those who are not at risk, though this is generally not done for non-infectious, non-epidemic diseases such as psychiatric illnesses. It is essential that the denominator and numerator are not mutually exclusive, that is the diseased group must be a part of the studied population. Hence, when measuring the incidence of psychosis, the population above the age of 16 is the relevant denominator. The year 1981 is the midinterval period between 1965 and 1997.

      "E": "Both incidence and prevalence will remain unaffected"

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Prevalence is defined as the number of ‘existing’ cases in a specified population for a period of observation (either cross-sectional observation, called point prevalence, or longitudinal observation for a specified time, called period prevalence). The existing cases include all new cases and all cases diagnosed before the observation but still suffering from the disease, but existing cases excludes those who have been previously diagnosed but are now cured or dead. For illnesses that are significantly chronic (e.g. schizophrenia), prevalence will be higher compared to those illnesses that are acute and short lived (e.g. influenza), even if the incidence rates are comparable. Hence the simple expression prevalence = incidence × duration of illness explains the relationship between incidence and prevalence. Freeman J and Hutchison GB. Prevalence, incidence and duration.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Certain factors can influence incidence and prevalence differently. For example if a new vaccine is developed to prevent an illness, both incidence and prevalence may come down. If a cure is developed for schizophrenia, incidence may not be affected but prevalence could drop. Similarly, if interventions are introduced to reduce mortality in chronic schizophrenia, then prevalence may paradoxically increase due to longevity of patients.

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Mortality rates are a special type of incidence rates where ‘death’ is the defined ‘case’ of interest. Crude mortality rate is the ratio between number of deaths due to all cause in a population and total population size. Cause-specific mortality rate, for example alcohol-specific mortality, refers to the ratio between the number of deaths due to alcohol in a population and total population size. A standardized rate is a rate applicable to a hypothetical population with an adjusted variable, for example age. As population samples are heterogeneous, crude rates from one population may not be comparable to another population. For example suicide rates in inner London may not be comparable to rates in rural Yorkshire, as the working-age population may be higher in London, spuriously increasing suicide rates. Hence, standardized hypothetical populations are used on which observed rates from a population are applied and adjusted values are derived. These standardized values are easily comparable, but they are not subgroup incidence rates. US Department of Health and Human Services.

    "explanation": "This is an example of cause-specific (suicide is the cause) mortality rate in a population (number of schizophrenia patients). If the comparison is between the number of patients died with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and total number of patients at a given time interval, then this becomes case fatality rate for schizophrenia. If deaths due to suicides in a population with schizophrenia are compared with all-cause deaths in the same population then this will be proportionate mortality due to suicide. A ‘case’ of suicide cannot be identified alive, though patients who attempted suicides can be identified. So describing a ‘case’ fatality rate for suicide is meaningless. Nevertheless, method-specific case fatality can be derived for various modes of suicide attempts. US Department of Health and Human Services.

Prior to this, in 1986, the WHO published results from the International Pilot Study on Schizophrenia from seven countries; incidence of ICD 9 schizophrenia was estimated to be around 16 to 42 per 100 000 in a year. When schizophrenia was narrowly defi ned, this rate dropped to 7 to 14 per 100 000. McGrath et al. showed a fi vefold difference in the incidence rates of schizophrenia across various sites in their systematic review and meta-analysis of various epidemiological studies on schizophrenia. According to this work, it is concluded that the median global incidence rate of schizophrenia is 15 per 100 000; but this global rate is not as meaningful as site-specifi c rates due to the degree of variation demonstrated.

      "A": "Different scales were used for measuring new and old cases",
      "B": "Recall bias explains the high incidence rates",

    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Population attributable fraction refers to the proportion of a disease in the whole population that the group exposed to specifi c risk factors represents. It is calculated by fi nding out the difference between incidence rates in the total population and the exposed population, and expressing this difference as a proportion of the total population’s incidence rate. It is different from simple attributable risk, which expresses the difference in incidence rates between the exposed and non-exposed groups. Winter/ spring birth increases the risk of schizophrenia to a small extent (RR 1.11), but as the prevalence of birth itself is common in winter/ spring, 10.5% of all schizophrenia incidences can be attributed to the seasonal birth. The winter/ spring excess is positively associated with latitude. McGrath JJ. Variations in the incidence of schizophrenia: data versus dogma. Schizophrenia Bulletin 2006; 32: 195–197."

    "explanation": "If the measurement methodologies differ between how a case is ascertained for incidence and prevalence, then such differences will be uniformly present across various sites. Recall bias will not infl uence incidences measured using case notes or case registers. On the other hand, lifetime prevalence rates are susceptible to recall bias. Respondent bias, if present, must again operate uniformly and should affect various areas consistently, provided the same methods are used. A fatal disease must reduce prevalence rates uniformly. The most likely explanation is that the factors predisposing or precipitating the onset are different from the factors that serve to maintain the illness chronicity.

The results showed that persons with schizophrenia in the ‘developing’ world (e.g. Columbia, India, and Nigeria) had better outcomes than persons in ‘developed’ countries (e.g. Moscow, London, Washington, Prague, and Aarhus in Denmark). In total, 52% of persons in the developing countries were assessed to be in the ‘best’ outcome category (defi ned as a single episode only, followed by full or partial recovery) compared with 39% in the developed countries. There was a claim that acute onset of psychosis, being more common in the developing nations, confounded the IPSS results, but a subsequent, large-scale, multinational study sponsored by WHO, excluded mode of onset as being a confounding factor for the observed differences in outcome. Differential follow-up rates, differential outcome measures, differential sex and age distribution, and diagnostic ambiguities did not confound the above results, as proved later by Hopper and Wanderling.

    "explanation": "The Stirling County Study is one of the foremost psychiatric epidemiological studies. It was conducted on cross-sectional samples of the population living in Stirling County, Canada, in 1952, 1970, and 1992. The epidemiological data was revisited in 2000 and it showed that vernacular changes in semantic use of terms such as dysphoria could affect results of epidemiological surveys. Using the same diagnostic system (called DPAX-1) in 1952 and 1970, no increases in point prevalence of depression were noted, but when the same criteria were employed in 1992 a drop in prevalence was noted. This was due to a change in use of the term dysphoria in the studied population; this term went out of use by 1992, leading to a drop in the sensitivity of the diagnostic instrument DPAX-1. By increasing the number of questions exploring the mood state and changing the diagnostic system (to DPAX-2), similar prevalence rates were detected in 1992. Note that though the diagnostic categories changed between 1952 and 1992 this did not have a direct infl uence on the Stirling County Survey, which used a purpose-built instrument to measure the prevalence.

    "explanation": "Various studies, including NCS and its replication NCS-R, NESARC (National epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions) and ECA (Epidemiological Catchment Area Study), have implicated that lifetime prevalence of depression is changing. The Stirling County Study did not reveal such a signifi cant change in rates of depression. This apparent change in prevalence could be attributed to the use of different diagnostic instruments. DIS (Diagnostic Interview Schedule), used in the ECA, and its modifi ed improvised versions used in other studies relied on recall of lifetime prevalence. Signifi cant recall bias is expected for a progressively older cohort who will deny or could not recall their depressive episodes. This might have resulted in a spurious effect. NCS used DSM IIIR (10.1% depression 12-month period prevalence) while its replication used DSM IV (8.7% depression prevalence), with its clinical impairment and distress criteria making it possible that less patients will be diagnosed with DSM IV. In fact, it was later shown that if DSM IV criteria were reapplied then prevalence of depression drops from 10.1% to 6.4% in the NCS 1994. In addition, NCS excluded all those above age 54 but included a 15 to 17 age group (in contrast to NCS-R), inadvertently choosing the most prevalent population that might have infl ated the prevalence value. These fl aws were absent in NESARC, which showed nearly doubled point prevalence estimate of depression from 3.3 to 7% from 1992 to 2002. Hasin DS, Goodwin RD, Stinson FS et al.

The Isle of Wight Study was repeated when the cohort was around 14–15 years of age and the prevalence of psychiatric disorders was found to have increased from 5.7% to 8%. Marital disharmony predicted development of psychiatric problems by adolescence. A similar study carried out using a cohort followed up at Dunedin, New Zealand, revealed similar results.

    "explanation": "In most of the large-scale epidemiological surveys of the last two decades, screening is carried out in a population sample using layperson-administered, structured tools to identify ‘caseness’. This is later followed by clinician-led diagnostic assessment to confi rm such cases. It has been shown repeatedly that layperson diagnostic instruments diagnose more mental illness than those identifi ed by clinician administered, standardized instruments. The agreement between these two types of diagnostic tools is poor, around a kappa of 0.1 to 0.4 only, but no single instrument can be claimed to be superior for case ascertainment purposes.

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "To describe the development of psychiatric epidemiology, three ‘generations’ of studies are distinguished. Around 16 psychiatric epidemiological studies, carried out before World War II, belong to the fi rst generation. These studies focused primarily on the health-care agency- registered prevalence of mental disorders in relation to community characteristics. The second generation of psychiatric epidemiological studies followed an increased interest in the diagnostic criteria, classifi cation, and nomenclature of psychiatric disorders after World War II, when nearly 60 studies appeared. These were mainly fi eld surveys, conducted in unstructured clinical interviews. Consequently, the reliability of these studies was low. The third-generation studies started around 1970, with more effort put into increasing the reliability of psychiatric diagnoses. A major objective of the third-generation studies is to obtain precise estimates of prevalence and incidence of specifi c mental disorders, whereas second-generation studies focused on mental ill-health in general. It is claimed that a fourth generation of psychiatric epidemiological studies is in the making. This includes studies that include comprehensive sets of biological markers such as brain imaging, cerebrospinal fl uid examinations, blood sampling, etc. in the large-scale, cross-sectional surveys.

Though numerous risk factors, such as social isolation and adverse life events, are associated with the incidence of postnatal depression, none of these factors are specifi c enough to differentiate postnatal depression from depression occurring during other phases of a woman’s life. Depression is common in perimenopausal, peripubertal, and child-rearing or pregnant women. Postpartum depression is essentially same disease as major depression occurring at other times, with respect to its classifi catory status. Postpartum depression is not a continuum of postpartum psychosis, which is more closely associated with bipolar illness. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale is a self- rated scale with 10 items. It is a screening tool for detecting depression in mothers. Postpartum psychosis occurs following around 1 per 1000 live births.

The mean age of onset for men is around 22 years, for women this is slightly delayed—around 26 years. The illness tends to be secret in most patients with a delay of several years before treatment is sought. OCD is the fourth most common mental illness in world.
