Two variants of this personality disorder are specified in ICD10, and both share this general theme of impulsiveness and lack of self-control. In the impulsive type, the predominant characteristics are emotional instability and lack of impulse control. Outbursts of violence or threatening behaviour are common, particularly in response to criticism by others. In the borderline type, in addition to emotional instability, the patient's own self-image, aims, and internal preferences (including sexual) are often unclear or disturbed.
