        "explanation": "The process of ageing can be classified as primary ageing, which accounts for the relatively constant lifespan observed in a species, and secondary ageing, which explains much of the unpredictability among individual members of the species. The primary ageing process is most probably constitutional and is probably wired in the cellular machinery. This was demonstrated by Hayflick and colleagues, who showed that the maximum number of cell divisions that can occur in normal human cells in culture is approximately 40–60. Many functional capacities of the cells reduce as the cells approach the Hayflick limit. This ‘Hayflick phenomenon’ is under genetic control; it is not limited to laboratory culture methods. Pruning is a developmental phenomenon by which unnecessary synapses formed during brain development are removed. Apoptosis refers to programmed cell death. Spar JE and Rue AL.

It has been validated in patients with pathologically confirmed dementia. A cut-off score ≤4 supports a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s dementia while a score ≥7 favours vascular dementia. These cut-off values have a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 89%. Abrupt onset, fluctuating course, history of stroke, presence of focal neurological symptoms and signs strongly favour a diagnosis of vascular dementia. Other supporting features for a diagnosis of vascular dementia include stepwise deterioration, presence of nocturnal confusion, absence of changes in personality, presence of emotional incontinence, depression and a history of hypertension.

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In dementia complex ADL that require use of tools and equipment (instrumental ADLs) are affected earlier than basic ADL. Although self-report ADL measures are rare, they do exist. For example, the ADL-Prevention Instrument (ADL-PI) has a self-rated version and an informant version. Self-ratings are found to be closer to research observer’s ratings, while family members tend to under-rate the ADL. Data from self-report of functioning predicts mortality better than informant data. The Barthel Index consists of 10 items that measure a person’s ADL and mobility. It can be used to determine a baseline level of functioning and also to monitor changes in ADL over time. It is rated by carers or professionals. Currently, functional capacity measures are being used increasingly in pharmacological trials of patients with dementias as primary outcome measures. ADL scales are not gender biased and are commonly used in both sexes. Massoud F. The role of functional assessment as an outcome measure in antidementia treatment.

It measures several cognitive domains, including memory, language, and praxis with total scores ranging from 0 to 70. A four-point change on the ADAS-Cog at 6 months after starting antidementia drugs has been used as an arbitrary cut-off point indicating a clinically important difference. This pharmaceutical cut-off on ADAS-Cog must be interpreted in the context of overall response when it is translated to clinical practice. MMSE is not as sensitive to change as ADAS-Cog; hence, it is rarely used as a primary outcome measure in dementia trials. An MRI brain scan currently has no role in monitoring treatment response.

The symptoms of hyponatraemia overlap with those of depression, making it hard to diagnose. Hyponatraemia due to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or other antidepressant use is often linked to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Increased age, female gender and co-prescription of diuretics are notable risk factors. Symptoms usually occur when the blood serum level falls below 130 mmol/L.

        "explanation": "Plaques seen in the brain of patients with Alzheimer’s dementia are insoluble extracellular deposits composed mainly of Aβ peptides. These Aβ peptides are derived from a transmembrane protein called B-amyloid precursor protein (APP) through proteolytic processing. APP is generally cleaved by β-secretase or α-secretase enzymes followed by γ-secretase. Aβ peptides are generated when APP is cleaved by β-secretase followed by γ-secretase. This pathway is amyloidogenic and forms the major metabolic pathway of APP in brain tissue; the non-amyloidogenic α-secretase pathway is the major pathway in other tissues. Presenilins are necessary for proteolytic activity of γ-secretase. PS/ γ-secretase complex is widely considered as a potential target for developing therapies against Alzheimer’s disease. Selkoe DJ.

A quarter of all DLB patients have no extrapyramidal signs at all until death. So parkinsonism is not necessary for clinical diagnosis of DLB. Often a diagnosis of DLB is missed as clinicians look for extrapyramidal signs or suspect cerebrovascular disease. The pattern of extrapyramidal signs in DLB shows greater postural/gait instability and facial impassivity but less tremor. This pattern of parkinsonism is over-represented in both DLB and demented patients with Parkinson’s disease. But non-demented Parkinson’s disease patients show equal distribution of a tremor-dominant pattern and postural/gait instability pattern. It is possible that the tremor-related pattern is more dopamine-dependent dysfunction whereas postural/gait problems are more non-dopaminergic. McKeith I, Mintzer J, Aarsland D, et al.

Microstructural white matter abnormalities may also perpetuate depressive symptoms in older adults by disrupting connectivity with cortico-striato-limbic networks, which form the basis of mood regulation. Lower fractional anisotropy in this network predicted poorer treatment response in geriatric depression.

        "explanation": "Late-life depression often occurs in the context of medical health issues; it is two to three times more common in the medically ill elderly patient. The diagnosis ‘depression due to a general medical condition’ (more commonly, secondary depression) is used when depressed mood or anhedonia occur in patients already diagnosed with an illness that is clearly linked to depression as a physiological consequence. For example, nearly 25% of patients with myocardial infarction have a major depressive episode. Primary depression can exist alongside a general medical condition with no direct physiological relationship. In fact, such co-existing depression and a general medical condition is more common than depression secondary to medical problems. Depression may also exacerbate the outcome of medical illnesses. Although hypothyroidism is considered to cause depression traditionally, recent studies show that a TSH value of 10 μU/L or greater was found in only 0.7% of elderly patients with clinical depression. Thus the rate of subclinical hypothyroidism in an elderly depressed group may be similar to that of the elderly population in general. Kroenke K. A 75-year-old man with depression.

        "explanation": "Some individuals with abnormal grief reaction may be avoiding reminders of their grief, leading to unresolved emotions. Addressing these issues by encouragement may not be sufficient and a behavioural approach may be needed in some cases. The approach commonly used is known as guided mourning. This treats unresolved grief in a way similar to other forms of phobic avoidance by exposure to the avoided situation. Thus guided mourning involves intense reliving of avoided painful memories and feelings associated with bereavement. During treatment, patients are exposed to avoided painful memories or situations related to the loss of their loved one – both in imagination and in real life. Clark A. Working with grieving adults.

Late-onset major depression includes a large subgroup of patients with neurological problems. It is possible that milder, unnoticed episodes of depression with early-onset might be a risk factor for late-life depression by contributing to brain abnormalities. When compared with elderly individuals with early-onset major depression, patients with late-onset major depression have a less frequent family history of mood disorders, a higher prevalence of disorders of dementia, a larger impairment in neuropsychological tests, a higher rate of dementia development on follow-up, more neurosensory hearing impairment, a greater enlargement in lateral brain ventricles, and more white matter hyperintensities.

        "explanation": "Reminiscence therapy uses materials such as old newspapers and household items to stimulate memories and enable people to share and value their experiences. The evidence base for this therapy in improving behavioural problems is limited. It may have a modest impact on mood symptoms. Validation therapy is based on Rogerian humanistic psychology; it encourages individual uniqueness and gives the opportunity to resolve conflicts by encouraging and validating the expression of feelings and emotions. Reality orientation therapy is based on the fact that patients with dementia function poorly secondary to impairment in orientating information (day, date, weather, time, and use of names) Hence reminders can improve functioning. Cognitive stimulation therapy is similar to reality orientation therapy but aims at improving information processing rather than factual knowledge to address problems in functioning in patients with dementia. Snoezelen therapy is also called multisensory stimulation. It is grounded on the supposition that neuropsychiatric symptoms may result from periods of sensory deprivation. It combines relaxation and exploration of sensory stimuli (e.g. lights, sounds, and tactile sensations). Livingston G, Johnston K, Katona C, et al.

This was adapted by Kubler-Ross, who described a five-stage response of terminally ill patients to impending death: denial–dissociation–isolation, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance (mnemonic: DABDA). A longitudinal cohort study (Yale Bereavement Study) has established that in terms of absolute frequency, disbelief was not the initial grief indicator as proposed by the original grief theory. The study found that most people endorsed acceptance as initial reaction even in the initial month after loss in cases of natural deaths. In contrast, family members of those who had a traumatic death and individuals with complicated grief disorder had significantly lower levels of acceptance. It was also noted that prognostic awareness of a patient’s terminal illness for more than 6 months before death may promote acceptance of the death.

The risk of conversion to dementia is four times higher in 5 years when hippocampal atrophy is present. It is generally accepted that the closer one’s cognitive ability, brain imaging, and genetic susceptibility are to AD, the more likely is the progression to dementia from MCI. Other factors predicting conversion include older age, greater severity of baseline cognitive deficits, especially impaired episodic recall and hypoperfusion of multiple brain regions in neuroimaging studies. It is also noted that multidomain amnestic MCI has a higher conversion rate than pure amnestic MCI. This conversion is more pronounced if the cognitive complaints are accompanied by carers’ reports of impaired daily function. Sensory impairment has no role in such predictions. DeCarli C.

        "explanation": "It is very difficult to conclusively decide on epidemiological facts of mild cognitive impairment due to the variations in diagnostic terms and inclusion criteria used in epidemiological research. A prevalence between 3% and 19% has been reported in elderly people. The age-specific prevalence of MCI is greater than that of dementia. MCI is about four times more common than dementia when based on community assessment of non-institutionalized individuals. An incidence of 8–58 per 1000 per year and a risk of developing dementia of 11–33% over 2 years have been quoted. The progression of amnestic MCI to dementia has been examined in various clinical populations. Generally a yearly incidence of dementia of 10–15% has been quoted for those with MCI attending memory clinics (compare this with general rates of 1–2% in elderly people). Community-based studies show slightly lower rates of conversion closer to 5–10% per year. A significant number of those with amnestic MCI actually improve their cognitive performance during follow up.

The older the age at diagnosis, the higher the chances of death. For example, some studies have shown a difference in median survival time of around 5 years between those diagnosed with dementia at the age of 65 and those diagnosed at the age of 90. The median survival from initial diagnosis is higher for men than women in some studies but this is not consistently shown. The presence of frontal lobe release signs, extrapyramidal signs, and gait disturbance, history of falls, congestive heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, and diabetes at baseline may predict shorter survival. Based on numerous longitudinal studies, a median survival of 5–8 years has been estimated.

In addition galantamine also improves cholinergic neurotransmission by acting as an allosteric ligand at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to increase presynaptic acetylcholine release and postsynaptic neurotransmission. Rivastigmine inhibits butyrylcholinesterase in addition to its inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. Butyrylcholinesterase forms around 10% of the total cholinesterase in normal human brains and it is mainly associated with glial cells. With the progression of dementia, it is noted that acetylcholinesterase activity decreases while butyrylcholinesterase activity stabilizes or even increases in relation to glial proliferation. This may lead to changes in the ratio of acetylcholinesterase to butyrylcholinesterase.

There was evidence for increased drop-out rates with both galantamine and rivastigmine compared with donepezil. Tyrer P and Silk K., eds. Cambridge Textbook of Effective Treatments in Psychiatry.

        "question": "In the pharmacological management of delirium, haloperidol is the preferred agent from the available antipsychotic drugs. All of the following explain the above except",
        "options": {
            "A": "Availability of multiple routes of administration for haloperidol",
            "B": "Availability of guided dosing strategies for haloperidol in delirium",

            "E": "Lack of significant hypotensive effect"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Many practice guidelines for the treatment of patients with delirium support the use of antipsychotics as the drugs of choice in delirium. Haloperidol is the most frequently used due to the different available routes of administration, a lack of anticholinergic side-effects, few active metabolites, and the low likelihood of causing adverse effects such as sedation and hypotension, which can be difficult to manage in an acute confusional state. But as QT prolongation is a possible side-effect, it is advisable to have a baseline ECG before such use is attempted in high-risk patients. These recommendations do not have much evidence base but are largely driven by retrospective chart surveys; hence, there is a dearth of data on dosage guidance. It is suggested that haloperidol is given at half the adult dose in elderly people. Tyrer P and Silk K., eds. Cambridge Textbook of Effective Treatments in Psychiatry.

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Gingko biloba extract is widely used as a herbal preparation for dementia and other cognitive difficulties. Gingko has a significant effect on prostaglandin metabolism and it antagonizes the platelet aggregating factor. As a result platelet function may be compromised especially when other anticoagulants like warfarin are co-administered. Many cases of internal bleeding and postoperative bleeding have been attributed to Gingko. Monitoring bleeding time may be an option in high-risk patients, but this is only a crude measure of platelet dysfunction. Fong KCS and Kinnear PE.

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Charles Bonnet syndrome is a common cause of complex visual hallucination in elderly people. 10% to 15% of visually impaired elderly patients may have this syndrome. The eponym comes from the Swiss naturalist and philosopher Charles Bonnet, who reported the hallucinations of his 89-year-old grandfather, who was blind with cataracts but saw multiple animated objects. Core features of Charles Bonnet syndrome include the occurrence of recurrent well-formed, vivid, elaborate, and often stereotyped visual hallucinations in a partially sighted person. The patient usually retains insight into the unreal nature of the images. It is important to consider other differential diagnoses, such as Lewy body dementia, psychosis, delirium, neurological illness, and intoxication. Manford M and Andermann F.

        "explanation": "Patients with so-called Diogenes syndrome are characterized by aloofness and breakdown of self-care to a severe extent; in some cases they may pose an environmental health hazard. Many of them are resistant to intervention from any agency, including relatives. Men and women are equally affected, but the condition is rare. An annual incidence of 0.5 per 1000 of the population aged over 60 years is reported. Diogenes syndrome is not a diagnostic category and patients form a heterogeneous group with respect to diagnoses. Some of them may have personality disorders, some have dementia while some are diagnosed with late-onset schizophrenia. Overall mortality is high for such patients. Murray R, Kendler K, et al., eds.

        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Traditionally an optimistically high rate of 10–20% of diagnosed dementia was thought to be due to reversible causes. A systematic review and meta-analysis of evidence in this regard shows a much lower rate of dementia due to potentially reversible causes to be 9% and actual (partial or full) reversal takes place in only 0.6%. Potentially reversible causes tend to be seen more in relatively young patients or in those with more recent onset of symptoms. It is not clear if an improvement in diagnostic practices in primary care has contributed to a lower proportion of patients with reversible dementia being referred. Depression being wrongly diagnosed as dementia forms the major proportion of reversible dementia; metabolic and endocrine issues such as hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 deficiency are other common causes. Subdural hematoma, cerebral tumours, and normal pressure hydrocephalus can cause potentially reversible dementias, although the degree of reversibility is controversial. Clarfield AM.

        },
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The prevalence of alcohol use disorders in elderly people is generally lower than in younger adults, but it is generally accepted that the rates are underestimated because of underdetection and misdiagnosis. It is known that elicitation and documentation of alcohol misuse in the medical records of the elderly people is poor. In addition, elderly people are less likely to spontaneously disclose alcohol use. Even in those identified with alcohol misuse, referral to a specialist team is very low, probably due to a degree of existing therapeutic nihilism (the belief that the illness is incurable) among health workers. Alcohol problems often present atypically in elderly people – falls, confusion, and depression are common presentations. It is also often masked by poor physical health. Furthermore, weekly limits of sensible drinking for adults, i.e. 21 units for men and 14 units for women, may not apply to elderly people. This is due to age-related changes in the pharmacokinetics of alcohol. In most countries, age-appropriate limits have not been established for elderly people. A history of lifetime alcohol consumption may be more important than current levels of drinking to ascertain the degree of alcohol use in elderly people. The CAGE questionnaire has relatively good sensitivity and specificity in older people, but, compared with younger adults, it works better in elderly people when supplemented by further questions.

        "explanation": "Various risk factors have been proposed from prospective analysis of elder abuse. Shared living situation is a major risk factor; older people living alone are at lowest risk. Having a ‘poor social network’ and subsequent social isolation significantly increases the risk of mistreatment. A diagnosis of dementia makes elderly people more vulnerable to mistreatment. The prevalence rates of elder abuse in samples of dementia caregivers is far higher than the elder abuse seen in the general community. Similarly, a higher rate of mental illness, such as depression or substance abuse, among caregivers increases the risk of elder abuse. It is also found that perpetrators of elder abuse tend to be financially dependent on the abused individual. Lachs, MS and Pillemer, K. Elder abuse. Lancet 2004; 364: 1263–1273"

In addition, RCT evidence exists for use of antidepressants for depressive symptoms in dementia.
