External validity is the degree to which the results of a study becomes applicable outside the experimental setting in which the study was conducted. In other words, external validity refers to generalizability of study results while internal validity refers to rigorousness of the research method. The benefi t of agomelatine in different populations (choices A and E) refers to external validity; the cost of the drug and consistency of results obtained from different studies are related to applicability of the intervention in a clinical setting. Assessment of adherence to study protocol is one of many ways of analysing the quality of an intervention trial. Slack MK and Drugalis JR.

In the given trial, the response rate is characterized by a 50% drop in HAMD from baseline. Forty per cent of those taking drug X achieve this response. In contrast, this rate is 20% for the placebo. This means that 20% (40 – 20%) additional patients responded to the drug compared with placebo. In other words, if we treat another 100 patients with X, 20 extra patients will respond to X than those treated with a placebo. So we need to treat at least fi ve people in order to see a benefi t in one additional patient. This value fi ve is known as the NNT. This can be calculated in another way. As you read further, you will note that 20% is the absolute benefi t increase (ABI = EER – CER). And from the formula, NNT = 1/ABI, we get 1/20% = 5. Cook RJ and Sackett DL.

In the question, 20% of participants on X experienced suicidal ideas compared with 10% on placebo. Put in other words, the drug is responsible for suicidal ideas in an extra 10% of patients. So, if 100 patients receive the drug, 10 extra patients will experience suicidal ideas. That is, for every 10 people treated, one additional patient will experience suicidal ideas. Hence the NNH is 100/10 = 10. This obviously can be calculated from the formula NNH = 1/ARI (absolute risk increase) = 1/10% = 10. It is highly unlikely that X was marketed by the company.

        "explanation": "This question tests one’s ability to calculate post-test probability from likelihood ratios. The probability of having a disease after testing positive with a diagnostic test depends on two factors: (a) the prevalence of the disease, (b) the likelihood of a positive test result using the instrument. It is important to remember that baseline prevalence of a disease for which a diagnostic instrument is being tested is taken as the pretest probability. So pretest probability = 10% Now, post-test odds = likelihood ratio × pretest odds From a given probability odds can be calculated using the formula odds = (probability)/(1 – probability) Here pretest odds = (10%)/(1 – 10%) = 10/90 = 1/9. Now post-test odds = likelihood ratio × pretest odds = 10 × 1/9 = 10/9 Using the formula probability = odds/(1 + odds) post-test probability = (10/9)/[1 + (10/9)] = 10/19 = 52.3% Guyatt G and Rennie D, eds.

Applying principles of evidence-based medicine, one must check for the internal validity of a study and the degree of generalizability before adapting the results to clinical practice. One must also be aware of the fact that though clinically more meaningful, NNTs quoted in RCTs may not translate to the same extent in actual clinical practice. One way of appreciating the usefulness of a newly introduced drug is to calculate the NNT for one’s own clinical population (target population). To enable this one may estimate the patient expected event rate (PEER), which is given by the expected spontaneous resolution rate or the response rate for an existing standard treatment. This can be obtained from the local audit data or clinical experience. The product of PEER and relative benefi t increase from the published RCT gives the new absolute benefi t increase (ABI new) value for the target population. The inverse of the new ABI gives the new NNT for the target population. The disease prevalence rate or absolute size of the target population has no effect on the new NNT.

Block randomization and stratifi ed randomization can be used to ensure the balance between groups in size and patient characteristics. But it is very diffi cult to stratify using several variables in a small sample. A widely acceptable alternative approach is minimization. This method can be used to ensure very good balance between groups for several confounding factors irrespective of the size of the sample. With minimization the treatment allocated to the next participant enrolled in the trial depends (wholly or partly) on the characteristics of those participants already enrolled.

Pragmatic RCTs are a type of RCTs introduced with the intention of increasing external validity, i.e. generalizability of RCT results. But this takes place at the expense of internal validity. In pragmatic RCTs the trial takes place in a setting as close as possible to natural clinical practice, i.e. the inclusion and exclusion criteria are less fastidious, often ‘treatment as usual’ is employed for comparisons, instead of placebos and real world, functionally signifi cant outcomes are considered.

Kappa is a measure of the level of agreement in excess of that which would be expected by chance. It is calculated as the observed agreement in excess of chance, expressed as a proportion of the maximum possible agreement in excess of chance. In other words kappa = the difference between observed and expected agreement/(1 – expected agreement). In this example, the observed agreement is 78%. The expected agreement is 50%.

Choice C is practically impossible; to share controls of one RCT with another means the trial is open label. When each subject in the trial receives both intervention and placebo with a washout period in between while remaining blind to the intervention, this is called as crossover RCT. Crossover trials are possible only if short-term outcomes are evaluated in chronic diseases. This is because the disease process must be suffi ciently long for the subject to receive both interventions across its course. Any intervention applied in a crossover setting must not permanently alter the disease process. Sibbald B and Roberts C. Understanding controlled trials: Crossover trials.

But the major drawback of RCTs is that the process takes place under highly experimental conditions, which are not seen in clinical practice. So any results achieved from such RCTs, though valid, may not be reproducible in everyday practice. In order to circumvent this issue, more naturalistic trials that retain core principles of RCT such as randomization, longitudinal follow-up, and controlled intervention are being increasingly used. Such real-world RCTs are called pragmatic trials or effectiveness trials. Such trials can be useful to fi nd out if an intervention will be effective in clinical practice, although they may not be suitable to study the biological effi cacy of a drug. A pragmatic RCT may reject various practices seen in an explanatory RCT, such as strict exclusion criteria, blinding, placebo use, fi xed dose intervention, high follow-up care, per-protocol analysis, etc. But basic principles such as randomization and use of probability theory (hypothesis testing and p values) are retained.

If we think that a number of participants drop-out because of non-effi cacy, dropping them out of the analysis would project a favourable outcome for the drug in question. Hence the LOCF method takes the last observation and utilizes it in the analysis. For illustration, we take two subjects, in a trial of antidepressants. Antidepressant trial Montgomery–Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS) Subject 1 Subject 2 Baseline 30 30 Week 1 20 30 Week 2 10 30 (drop-out due to non effi cacy) Week 3 5 30 Final score 1 30 Subject 1, improves signifi cantly over the 4 weeks, his MADRS score has dropped to 1 from a baseline of 30, while Subject 2 dropped out of the study in the second week, due to non-effi cacy. If we remove subject 2 from the analysis, the mean score at the end would be 1 (an whopping improvement of 29 points on the MADRS), while if we carry forward his last observation score (week 2) of 30 to the end and took the mean of the two scores (15.05), the drop is only 15 points from the mean baseline score of 30. Trials of Alzheimer’s disease interventions are different, since we do not expect (although we most defi nitely would like to see) improvement in the cognitive score, but a rather slow decline in scores over time, in spite of the medications, due to the progressive nature of the illness. If a patient drops out early because of the experience of adverse effects, carrying forward his score to the endpoint analysis will falsely project a favourable outcome. Again to illustrate, let us consider a trial of cholinesterase inhibitors. ChI trial MMSE Subject 1 Subject 2 Baseline 20 20 Week 1 20 20 (drops out because of side effects) Week 2 10 20 Week 3 5 20 Final score 1 20 Subject 1 experienced a decline of 19 points over 4 weeks, while the second subject dropped out the fi rst week, when his MMSE had not declined. If we carry forward his last observation of 20, it will look like there was no deterioration at all, and the difference in the mean scores over time would be diluted to 10, rather than a drop of 19. As a corollary, the reason for drop-out is another important issue. In trials of Alzheimer’s disease interventions, early drop-outs are most probably due to adverse effects, while late drop-outs are due to non-effi cacy. This can again project a favourable outcome for the drug. Streiner DL. The case of the missing data: methods of dealing with dropouts and other research vagaries.

        "explanation": "There are a number of ways to manage heterogeneity. The easiest way would be to avoid it. This includes using strict inclusion criteria to include studies that are as similar as possible. In case of continuous variables, one of the ways would be to transform the data so that all data look similar and are less heterogeneous. Meta regression is a collection of statistical procedures to assess heterogeneity, in which the effect size of study is regressed on one or several covariates, with a value defi ned for each study. The fi xed-effect model of meta-analysis as reported in this question, considers the variability between the studies as exclusively due to random variation. The random-effects model assumes a different underlying effect for each study and takes this into consideration as an additional source of variation. The effects of the studies are assumed to be randomly distributed and the central point of this distribution is the focus of the combined (pooled) effect estimate. If there were some types of studies that were likely to be quite different from the others, a subgroup analysis may be done.

        "explanation": "Odds are the probability of an event occurring divided by the probability of the event not occurring. An odds ratio is the odds of the event in one group (e.g. intervention group) divided by the odds in another group (e.g. control group). Odds ratios tend to exaggerate the true relative risk to some degree. But this exaggeration is kept minimal and even negligible if the probability of the studied outcome is low (empirically, less than 10%); in such cases the odds ratio approximates the true relative risk. As the event becomes more common the odds ratio no longer remains a useful proxy for the relative risk. It is suggested that the use of odds ratios should probably be limited to case-control studies and logistic regression examining dichotomous variables. As risk refers to the probability of an event occurring at a time point, in other words it is the same as the incidence rate. The inherent cross-sectional nature of a case–control study (where ‘existing cases’ are recruited) does not allow one to study ‘new’ incidences. Hence we cannot measure risk, and so relative risk, from case–control designs. Katz KA. The (relative) risks of using odds ratios. Archives of Dermatology 2006; 142: 761–764."

        "explanation": "N-of-1 trials are randomized double-blind multiple crossover comparisons of an active drug against placebo in a single patient. The design uses a series of pairs of treatment periods called modules. Within each module the patient receives active treatment during one period and either an accepted standard treatment or placebo in the other. Random allocation determines the order of the two treatment periods within each pair and both clinician and patient are blinded for the intervention. This design is mostly suited for chronic recurrent conditions for which long-term interventions exist that are not curative. Interventions with rapid onset and offset of effects are best suited for n-of-1 trials. This allows shorter treatment periods wherein multiple modules of intervention and placebo/standard treatment can be compared, increasing the chance of achieving a statistically signifi cant result. It is also necessary that the interventions tested must be cleared from the patient’s system within a fi nite washout period. Price JD and Evans JG.

        "explanation": "Publication bias refers to the tendency of journals to accept and publish certain types of studies more often than the others. In general, studies with results that are impressively signifi cant or of higher quality by virtue of larger sample size are more successful in getting published. Publication bias can be considered as a form of selection bias when one attempts a systematic review or meta-analysis. Publication bias can be detected using a funnel plot – visual inspection of a graph drawn by plotting a measure of precision (often sample size) against treatment effect will reveal asymmetry of the two arms of the funnel-shaped graph if publication bias is present. Galbraith plot refers to a graph obtained by plotting a measure of precision such as (1/standard error) against standard normal deviate (log of odds ratio/standard error). The coordinates obtained from such a plot can be used to determine the extent of publication bias using linear regression. Failsafe N is another way of estimating publication bias. Consider a meta-analysis yielding a statistically signifi cant difference in outcome between two interventions, despite suspected publication bias. Then failsafe N answers the question ‘How many missing studies are needed to reduce the effect to statistical non-signifi cance?’ The higher the failsafe N, the lower the publication bias. If one could solicit and compare all unpublished data with published data, then publication bias would become obvious. Lawrie SM, McIntosh AM, and Rao S. Critical Appraisal for Psychiatry.

        "explanation": "Meta-analysis is generally done to combine the results of different trials, as individual clinical trials are often too small and hence underpowered to detect treatment effects reliably. Meta-analysis increases the power of statistical analyses by pooling the results of all available trials. But this comes at a small cost. Although similar studies are taken to be included in the meta-analysis, it is likely that each trial is different from each other just by chance. Sometimes the difference can occur due to foreseeable situations, e.g. the dosage of medication tested, the mean ages of the population tested, difference in the scales used, etc, may differ among studies. To measure if this heterogeneity is more than the random heterogeneity we expect, statisticians resort to certain tests of heterogeneity. They are statistical as in the chi-square test (or Q statistic), which tests the ‘null hypothesis’’ of homogeneity and the I-squared test (which measures the amount of variability due to heterogeneity). Galbraith’s plot and l’Abbé plot are pictorial representations of heterogeneity. A paired t test is generally not used to calculate the heterogeneity. Perera R, and Heneghan C.

The external criterion may be a measurement that can be obtained more or less at the same time (concurrent validity) or it may be an outcome that is predicted to occur in the future (predictive validity). If a test offers something over and above what is offered by an existing instrument, then incremental validity can be established. Internal consistency of a test refers to looking at how consistent the results are for different items (measuring the same construct) within the instrument studied.

It is an estimate of how many times more likely it was that a person who experienced a problem (dyspepsia) was exposed to the supposed cause (risk factor) than was a control subject (those not exposed to the risk factor). Let us consider the data in the table in a different way: the number of people who developed dyspepsia is 8 and those who did not develop dyspepsia is 75. The ‘odds’ of an event happening is the ratio of the probability of its occurrence to the probability of its non-occurrence. So in patients with dyspepsia, the probability of being on sertraline is A/A + C = 6/8 = 0.75. The probability of being on a placebo is C/A + C = 2/8 = 0.25. Therefore the odds of a person with nausea being on sertraline is 0.75/0.25 = 3 or simply A/C. Similarly, we can also calculate the odds of the person ‘without dyspepsia’ being on sertraline. It is 38/37 (B/D) = 1.02, i.e. the odds of having used sertraline in those who did not have nausea is 1.02. The ratio of these odds is simply called the odds ratio. The ratio = (A/C)/(B/D) or (AD/BC). That is, 3/1.02 or 6 × 37/2 × 38 = 222/76 = 2.92. The odds ratio is interpreted in a manner more or less similar to the relative risk. Confi dence intervals are provided and interpreted in the same manner. Odds ratios are usually used in case control studies and in meta-analyses as primary summary measures. Streiner DL.

The ACER captures the average cost per effect, i.e. cost of treatment/effect of treatment. In this case, the cost of the new psychotherapy is £10,000 and the effect is 50 depression-free weeks. In the above question, the ACER for the new treatment (psychotherapy) will be C/E = 10,000/50 = £200. The ACER for antidepressants from the question will be 5000/45 = £111. Hoch JS and Dewa CS.

        "explanation": "In contrast to ACER, the ICER reports the ratio of the change in cost to the change in effect (for example ΔC/ΔE). In plain and simple language, this pretty much translates to the extra cost per extra effect, i.e. ΔC/ΔE. From the question, we can see ΔC = 10,000 – 5000 = 5000; ΔE = 50 – 45 = 5 weeks. So, ΔC/ΔE = 5000/5 = £1000. Again in plain language, this would mean that compared with antidepressants, the new treatment would cost an average of 1000 additional pounds per one added depression-free week. In many economic evaluations, the ICER indicates that a new treatment is relatively more costly (ΔC >0) and relatively more effective (ΔE >0) than usual care, as in the situation in the question. Now, it is for the decision makers to decide if this additional money is worth spending. Hoch JS and Dewa CS.

        "explanation": "An INB calculation determines whether the net benefi t of a new treatment outdoes that of usual care. In our case, the net benefi t of psychotherapy surpasses the benefi t of using antidepressants. In general, the INB is calculated by valuing ΔE in pounds and then subtracting the associated ΔC. This is where the society’s willingness to pay for the additional depression week comes into play. INB is calculated using the formula (ΔE × λ) – ΔC, where λ is society’s willingness to pay for a 1-unit gain of effect. In our question, ΔE = 5 weeks; the service managers are willing to pay around £1500/each depression free week (λ – willingness to pay) and ΔC is £5000. So, INB = (5 × 1500) – 5000 = 7500 – 5000 = £2500. The INB equation computes the net value of patient outcome gained in pounds. When the INB is positive, the value of a new treatment’s extra benefi ts (ΔE × λ) outweighs its extra costs (ΔC). In short, society values the extra effect more than the extra cost (i.e. ΔE × λ >ΔC). Conversely, when the INB is less than 0, society (or your health service management) does not consider the extra benefi t worth the extra cost. Hoch JS and Dewa CS.

Opportunity cost is assessed in not just monetary or material terms, but in terms of anything which is of value. The opportunity cost of investing in a healthcare intervention is best measured by the health benefi ts that could have been achieved had the money been spent on the next best alternative intervention.

The net benefi t approach forces decision makers to directly consider the issue of valuing additional patient outcomes. The INB can be computed with various λ s and analysed using multiple regression techniques. How sensitive the results are to the assumed λ value can be gauged using a cost effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC). The CEAC shows the probability that a new treatment is cost-effective for different values for λ. So in the given question, if λ is £150, the probability of it being cost-effective is >90%. But if the λ is £10, the probability is less than 25%. At the same time, the probability of cost-effectiveness is also >90% if λ was £100. So, it would be sensible for the decision maker to pay £100 for every depression-free day, rather than a £150. Hoch JS and Dewa CS.

Although dichotomizing continuous data leads to loss of information, in clinical practice, it makes sense to deal with dichotomous variables. For instance, with the new scale in the question, it would make sense if we can differentiate a depressed patient from a non-depressed patient, rather than just saying patient A had a greater score than patient B. In this situation, we should know where the ideal cut-off for the scale is. However, because the distributions of the scores in these two groups most often overlap, any cut-off point that is chosen will result in two types of errors: false negatives (that is, depressed cases judged to be normal) and false positives (that is, normal cases judged to be depressed). Changing the cut-off point will change the numbers of wrong judgements but will not eliminate the problem. The cut-off point also depends on if we want the test to be more sensitive (as in a screening test) or more specifi c (as in diagnostic tests). The ROC helps us to determine the ability of a test to discriminate between groups and to choose the optimal cut-off point. Streiner DL and Cairney J. What’s under the ROC?

        "explanation": "From the graph, we can see that the more the ROC curve deviates from the dotted line and tends toward the upper left-hand corner, the better the sensitivity and specifi city of the test. Hence it is generally considered that the cut-off point that’s closest to this corner is the one that minimizes the overall number of errors (‘the best trade off’); in this case, it is 6/7. Since the scale in our question is a screening test for depression, we would want it to be more sensitive rather than specifi c. As we can see from the fi gure, a cut-off score of 11/12 would give excellent specifi city, but very poor sensitivity, thus increasing the false negative rates. Streiner DL and Cairney J.

        "explanation": "The primary statistical measure obtained from the ROC is the AUC. The AUC value can be used to compare with the AUC value of a curve corresponding to the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is represented by a curve that could be obtained if the test has no usefulness in discriminating those with the diagnosis and those without. This hypothetical curve will then have an AUC of 0.50, which corresponds to the area in the graph that falls below the dotted line. The difference in the two AUC consists of the area of the graph between the dotted line and the curve. The AUC can be interpreted in another very useful way. AUC is the probability that the test will show a higher value for a randomly chosen individual with depression than for a randomly chosen individual without depression. That means, if we fi nd the AUC for this particular test was 0.9 and take two individuals at random, one with and one without depression, the probability that the fi rst individual will have a higher score than the second is nearly 90%. Fortunately, the AUC, the sensitivities and specifi cities, and the whole ROC are calculated by statistical software, sparing us of the burden. Streiner DL and Cairney J. What’s under the ROC?

        "explanation": "Meta-analyses are usually displayed in graphical form using Forest plots, which present the fi ndings for all studies plus (usually) the combined results. This allows the reader to visualize how much uncertainty there is around the results. The graph in question, modifi ed below, presents a Forest plot, sometimes called a ‘blobbogram’ identifying its basic components. The 95% CI are represented using Trial 1 horizontal lines. If the line crosses Trial 2 the line of no effect, the effect is not statistically significant.

If the confi dence intervals cross the line of no effect (at 0 in this case), it suggests that the effect is not statistically signifi cant. Out of the seven studies, the confi dence intervals of three of the effect sizes of three of the trials (1, 2 and 5) cross the line of no effect, and four (trials 3, 4, 6 and 7) do not cross the line.
