      "E": "Myasthenia gravis"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The answer is Parkinson’s disease. Bradykinesia or hypokinesia is a motor feature of Parkinson’s disease. Dysarthria is a defi cit in the motor aspect of speech. It is usually secondary to a motor neurological defi cit. Dysarthria can affect not only articulation, but also phonation, breathing, or prosody (emotional tone) of speech. Total loss of ability to articulate is called anarthria, whereas dysarthria usually involves the distortion of consonant sounds. The Mayo Clinic classifi cation of dysarthria divides dysarthria into six basic types, each one corresponding to a predominant motor disorder: fl accid (lower motor neurone disorders), spastic (upper motor neurone disorders), ataxic (cerebellar lesions), hypokinetic (parkinsonian), hyperkinetic (choreiform/tic disorders), and mixed. Mixed dysarthrias are seen in conditions with multiple motor lesions, for example mixed spastic–ataxia of multiple sclerosis or mixed spastic–fl accidity of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Speech therapy may be of substantial benefi t to many dysarthric patients. Cummings JL and Mega MS. Neuropsychiatry and Behavioural Neuroscience. Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 74.

    "question": "A 32-year-old man is diagnosed with a right-sided hemiparesis. Onexamination, his speech shows non-fl uent aphasia. His comprehension isintact, but repetition is impaired. He is most likely to have",
    "options": {
      "A": "Transcortical motor aphasia",

      "D": "Broca’s aphasia",
      "E": "Wernicke’s aphasia"
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Testing a person’s speech is usually done in three steps. The fi rst step is to test for the fl uency of speech. Non-fl uent output is characterized by a paucity of verbal output (usually 10–50 words per minute), whereas fl uent aphasics have a normal or even exaggerated verbal output (up to 200 words or more per minute). Lesions of the motor (Broca’s) area produce a non-fl uent aphasia. Assessment of language comprehension is the second step. Patients with focal lesions limited to the left frontal lobe (Broca’s area) will have preserved comprehension (Broca’s and transcortical motor aphasia). Patients with left posterior temporal or parietal involvement will show impaired comprehension (Wernicke’s, global, transcortical sensory, and isolation aphasias). The third step is to evaluate repetition. Transcortical aphasias usually have an intact repetition. Patients with Broca’s, Wernicke’s, or conduction aphasia typically show impaired repetition. In conduction aphasia, speech is fl uent (as in Wernicke’s aphasia) but comprehension is intact (unlike Wernicke’s aphasia). Cummings JL and Mega MS. Neuropsychiatry and Behavioural Neuroscience.

      "E": "Broca’s aphasia"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Transcortical sensory aphasia is similar to Wernicke,s aphasia but is distinguished by the retained ability to repeat. Lesions causing transcortical aphasias do not disrupt the perisylvian language circuit from Wernicke’s area through the arcuate fasciculus to Broca’s area. Instead, they interrupt connections from other cortical centres into the language circuit (hence the name transcortical). These areas include the dominant angular gyrus, posterior middle temporal gyrus, and periventricular white matter pathways of the temporal isthmus underlying these cortical areas. When this results from involvement of the angular gyrus, it is frequently accompanied by Gerstmann’s syndrome, constructional apraxia, and other evidence of the angular gyrus syndrome.

      "E": "Involvement of the posterior cerebral artery leads to global aphasia"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Paragrammatism is seen in Wernicke’s aphasia. Speech is characterized by being empty of meaning, containing verbal paraphasias, neologisms, and jargon productions. Most patients with Wernicke’s aphasia have no elementary motor or sensory defi cits. A right homonymous hemianopia may be present. Patients may be unaware of the defi cit and may present with paranoia, as they do not realize why others do not understand them. The presence of paragrammatism may be diffi cult to distinguish from formal thought disorder in schizophrenia. In contrast, Broca’s aphasia shows agrammatism. In this case, the speech pattern is non-fl uent; on examination, the patient speaks hesitantly, often producing the principal, meaning-containing nouns and verbs but omitting small grammatical words and morphemes. This pattern is called agrammatism or telegraphic speech, for example: ‘I go home’ or ‘wife here morning’. Reading is often impaired in Broca’s aphasia despite preserved auditory comprehension. Broca’s aphasia is associated with right hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, and apraxia of the non-paralysed left limbs. Due to the awareness of the defi cit, patients with Broca’s aphasia may be more prone to depression. Pure word deafness is a syndrome of isolated loss of auditory comprehension and repetition, without any abnormality of speech, naming, reading, or writing. It is caused by bilateral, or sometimes a unilateral, lesion, isolating Wernicke’s area from input from both Heschl’s gyri. A lesion representing most of the territory of the left middle cerebral (not posterior circulation) artery leads to a global aphasia. Bradley WG, Daroff RB, Fenichel G, and Jankovic J.

      "E": "Alexia without agraphia is seen in posterior cerebral artery stroke"
    },
    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Pure alexia without agraphia is associated with left posterior cerebral artery stroke, with infarction of the medial occipital lobe, often the splenium of the corpus callosum, and often the medial temporal lobe. Alexia is the acquired inability to read. Patients with alexia without agraphia can write but cannot read their own writing. Alexia with agraphia is sometimes called acquired illiteracy. Alexia with agraphia is seen in angular gyrus lesions and is associated with Gerstmann’s syndrome. It is seen in stroke of the angular branch of the middle cerebral artery. Transcortical aphasias are analogues to the syndromes of global, Broca’s, and Wernicke’s aphasias, with intact repetition. Lesions producing transcortical aphasias disrupt connections from other cortical centres into the language circuit.

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Inferior olivary lesions lead to appendicular ataxia which can be tested using the fi nger– nose test. The inferior olivary nucleus serves motor coordination via projecting climbing fi bres to the cerebellum. Isolated lesions of superior colliculus result in defective visual saccades. Subtle auditory defects are noted in similar lesions of the inferior colliculus. Pyramidal decussation carries corticospinal fi bres; damage to the corticospinal fi bres rostral to (above) the pyramidal decussation results in contralateral motor defi cits, while lesions below the decussation result in ipsilateral defi cits.

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Echolalia is the phenomenon where the patient repeats words or phrases said by the examiner; palilalia is the phenomenon where the patient repeats words or phrases that he has uttered himself. In patients who develop both phenomena, echolalia precedes the onset of palilalia. Common causes of echolalia include the transcortical aphasias and disorders that affect the basal ganglia–frontal circuit. Echolalia could be due to a frontal executive defi cit, leading to failure of environmental autonomy and resulting in echoing of perceived environmental stimuli. Palilalia should be distinguished from stuttering and logoclonia (repetition of the fi nal syllable of spoken words). Echolalia may be observed as part of speech disturbances in catatonic states.

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Hemispheric dominance is clinically inferred by handedness. It is a peripheral indicator of cerebral hemispheric language lateralization. Handedness is now considered to exist as a continuum, from extreme unilateral hand dominance on one end to ambidexterity on the other. In this respect, the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory is a semiquantitative measurement of handedness. It is thought that at least 90% of the human population is right-handed. Of these, 95% are left-hemisphere dominant. Approximately 10% of the human population is left-handed and of these at least 60% are left-hemisphere dominant.

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Medial temporal cortex is not supplied by the anterior communicating artery; it is supplied by the posterior cerebral artery. The anterior communicating artery supplies the basal forebrain and striatum. Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome is usually associated with nutritional causes, where the thalamic nuclei (especially dorsal medial thalamus) are involved, leading to anterograde amnesia and confabulation. Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is another cause of anterograde amnesia where anterior temporal lobes are often involved. Whether amnesia is predominantly verbal or non-verbal is determined by the side of lesion and the cerebral dominance. In CJD (Creutzfeldt–Jacob disease) diffuse cortical damage occurs.

    "explanation": "Balint’s syndrome consist of a triad of oculomotor apraxia (defi cits in the orderly visuomotor scanning of the environment), optic ataxia (inaccurate manual reaching toward visual targets), and simultanagnosia. Pathologically, Balint’s syndrome is produced by bilateral parieto- occipital lesions. Simultanagnosia is the inability to integrate visual information in the centre of gaze with more peripheral information. The patient gets stuck on the detail that falls in the centre of gaze without scanning the visual environment for additional information. They typically ‘miss the forest for the trees.’ This leads to a signifi cant disturbance in object identifi cation. A patient with Balint’s syndrome when shown a table lamp and asked to name the object may look at its circular base and call it an ash tray! Kasper DL et al., eds.

      "E": "Acalculia"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Dysarthria is not a feature of Gerstmann’s syndrome. Full Gerstmann’s syndrome, though rarely reported, consists of left–right disorientation, fi nger agnosia, dysgraphia, and dyscalculia. The lesion is mostly attributed to a dominant parietal lobe dysfunction. When all the components are present the syndrome reliably localizes to the dominant angular gyrus. Gerstmann himself thought that the inability to calculate was because of the fact that children learnt to count with their fi ngers and the dysgraphia was due to problems with differential fi nger movements—both being secondary to fi nger agnosia. Gerstmann noted that the greatest trouble in fi nger agnostics was with distinguishing second, third, and fourth fi ngers.

      "E": "Central achromatopsia"
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Anton’s syndrome features blindness and denial of blindness, that is the patient is blind but denies sightlessness. The syndrome is most commonly associated with bilateral lesions of the occipital cortex. Blind sight is a paradoxical syndrome seen in patients with cortical blindness. It is the ability of the person to orient towards visual stimuli while there is no conscious visual perception. This is due to the fact that 20 to 30% of fi bres of the optic tract are directed to non-geniculate destinations, such as the superior colliculi and pretectal region of the brainstem. It is thought that some visual processing occurs in this non-geniculate system. This phenomenon is not demonstrable if the blindness is the result of pregeniculate lesions. Geschwind’s syndrome refers to personality changes proposed to be due to disconnection of brain areas noted in those with temporal lobe epilepsy. The Charcot–Wilbrand syndrome, or irreminiscence, is characterized by the inability to generate an internal mental image or revisualize (imagine) an object. The patients have more diffi culty in generating objects through drawing than in copying model fi gures. It is usually secondary to bilateral parietal lobe lesions.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Ideational apraxia (IDA) is an inability to correctly sequence a series of acts that lead to a goal. Asking the patient to carry out a multistep, sequential task, such as preparing a sandwich for work, is a good test of IDA. It is most often associated with degenerative dementia and delirium. Ideomotor apraxia is probably the most common type of apraxia. Patients with ideomotor apraxia make spatial and temporal errors when performing learned, skilled movements including pantomimes, imitations, and using actual objects. When pantomiming the use of a screwdriver, patients with ideomotor apraxia may rotate their arm at the shoulder and fi x their elbow. In right-handed individuals ideomotor apraxia is almost always associated with left-hemisphere lesions. A variety of structures, including the corpus callosum, the inferior parietal lobe, and the premotor areas, may be involved. Patients with ideomotor apraxia can imitate actions of others (using tools/objects) but have diffi culty pantomiming (in the absence of tools/objects). In patients with conduction apraxia, imitation is worse than pantomiming. The site of the lesion has not been localized (unlike conduction aphasia).

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The term agnosia was originally introduced by Freud. In general, patients with agnosia have clinical feature of impaired recognition of sensory stimuli despite normal sensory pathways. Agnosia represents a disorder of higher-order sensory processing. There is an impaired ability to recognize the nature or meaning of sensory stimuli. This is usually modality specifi c. There are two basic categories of agnosia. Apperceptive agnosia involves impaired generation of the minimal integrated percept necessary for meaningful recognition. This defect, leads to the formation of an inadequate minimal object recognition unit (i.e. the minimum information required to meaningfully interpret the percept). For example, a \"pencil\" is initially perceived as—\"long, thin, pointed at one end, etc\", before a meaning (\"it is a pencil—it is used to write\") is attributed to the percept. Patients are unable to distinguish visual shapes and so have trouble recognizing, copying, or discriminating between different visual stimuli. Associative agnosia involves defective association of meaning with percepts. The defect is in associating a correctly perceived percept with its meaning. Patients can describe visual scenes and classes of objects but still fail to recognize them. Patients suffering from associative agnosia are still able to reproduce an image through copying. Anosognosia refers to being unaware of a neurological state/illness. Abulia refers to loss of drive or motivation seen in cingulate lesions. Goldstein MA. and Silverman ME.

      "E": "Episodic memory is more often preserved than semantic memory in dementia.NEUROSCIENCES | QUESTIONS 165"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Memories of specifi c experiences formed in specifi c contexts are called episodic, for example the meal one had 3 weeks ago at a restaurant. Episodic memory is explicit, that is it is consciously acquired (we know how and where we acquire it) and declarative, that is it can be consciously recalled. Episodic memory depends largely on the integrity of the medial temporal lobe, but there are other structures that are involved in episodic memory. These include the frontal lobe, basal forebrain, retrosplenial cortex, presubiculum, fornix, mammillary bodies, mammillothalamic tract, anterior nucleus of the thalamus, etc. Damage to any one of these structures can result in defi cits in episodic memory. Hence episodic memory loss cannot be said to be characteristic of a medial temporal lesion. Episodic memory impairment could manifest as anterograde or retrograde amnesia. Anterograde amnesia refers to impairment in new memory formation and retrograde amnesia refers to the loss of previously acquired memories. Episodic memory applies to both personal and public events. In most dementias, semantic memory loss occurs at later stages than episodic memory loss. Budson AE and Price BH. Memory dysfunction. New England Journal of Medicine 2005; 352: 692–699"

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Semantic memory describes memories for general information which is unrelated to other information, for example dates in history, the colour of our national fl ag, or the characteristics of different species of dinosaurs (encyclopaedic facts). Semantic memory is explicit and declarative (see explanation to the previous question). In the most general sense, semantic memory refers to all of our knowledge of the world; however, semantic memory is more usually tested in the context of naming and categorization tasks. It is localized to the inferior lateral temporal lobes. The frontal lobes are responsible for providing information to, and retrieving information out of, the semantic memory banks.

    },
    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The woman described in the question probably suffers from dissociative amnesia, in this case precipitated by the stress of separation. Systematized amnesia is the loss of memory for a certain category of information such as material relating to one’s family or a particular person. In this case, her boy friend. Localized amnesia is the condition where the individual fails to recall events that occurred during a circumscribed period of time. In selective amnesia the person can recall some but not all events during a circumscribed period of time. Generalized amnesia is characterized by a failure to recall all of a person’s past life. There may be dissociation between explicit and implicit memory, for example the person may retain all his learned skills, but completely forget who he is or his past (a la Jason Bourne in the Bourne trilogy). Continuous amnesia is a condition featuring an inability to recall events subsequent to a specifi c time up to and including the present. Cummings JL and Mega MS.

    "options": {
      "A": "Episodic memory",
      "B": "Semantic memory",
      "C": "Procedural memory",
      "D": "Working memory",
      "E": "Retrograde memory"
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Working memory describes the ability to temporarily hold information in mind and manipulate it as required by circumstances, for example doing mental arithmetic. It may be phonological, such as keeping a phone number in mind for as long as it takes to dial or visuospatial, such as following a mental map while cycling to work. Baddeley described a central executive system in working memory, which is central to manipulation of the data held in the ‘phonological loop’ or the ‘visuospatial sketchpad’. In short, working memory is what allows us to mentally add up the cost of the number of pints of lager we had at the pub, subtract the total from the value of the money we give the bar tender, and calculate the change that is due to us. Prefrontal cortex is the most important structure for working memory, due to the extensive role played by the central executive; other structures involved include posterior parietal cortices. Disturbances of working memory can result in anterograde disturbances to other systems of memory as well, because intact working memory is generally required for the encoding of information. Episodic memory may be particularly affected. Budson AE and Price BH. Memory dysfunction. New England Journal of Medicine 2005; 352: 692–699"

    },
    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Procedural memory describes the ability to learn and perform tasks without conscious thought. This is disturbed in conditions that involve subcortical basal ganglia structures such as Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and olivopontocerebellar degeneration. Procedural memory defi cits may also be found in depression and OCD. In conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, mild cognitive impairment, Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia, the frontal variant of frontotemporal dementia, encephalitis, Korsakoff’s syndrome, traumatic brain injury, hypoxic–ischaemic brain injury (including cardiac bypass surgeries), temporal lobe surgery, seizures, vitamin B defi ciency, hypoglycaemia, transient 12 global amnesia, and multiple sclerosis, episodic memory is more likely to be impaired. Mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders may also show episodic memory disturbances. Finally, episodic memory impairment may be a side-effect of treatment with anticholinergic drugs and ECT. Semantic memory may be disturbed in conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, the temporal variant of frontotemporal dementia, traumatic brain injury, and encephalitis. Working memory is disturbed in most of the conditions listed above. Working memory is also impaired in anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, OCD, ADHD, other psychiatric states, and medications.

      "E": "The patient’s memory of events before the onset of amnesia is always normal"
    },
    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The condition described is Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome. Although the common cause for the syndrome is malnutrition secondary to alcohol use, a number of other conditions including hyperemesis during pregnancy, gastrectomy, pyloric stenosis, etc. are associated. In addition to diffi culty learning new information, patients with Korsakoff’s syndrome usually have a retrograde amnesia which could extend back up to several years prior to the onset of the syndrome. Patients usually remain amnesic for 1–3 months after onset and then begin to recover gradually over a 10-month period; 25% recover completely and 25% have no demonstrable recovery. CT scan may reveal bilateral hypodense areas in the medial thalamus in patients with acute Wernicke’s encephalopathy, and mamillary body atrophy may be demonstrated by MRI in some patients with chronic Korsakoff’s syndrome. Confabulation is common during the early phases of Korsakoff’s syndrome but is unusual in the chronic phase of the condition. Administration of thiamine during the acute Wernicke’s phase may prevent emergence of Korsakoff’s syndrome.

      "B": "Glasgow Coma Scale",
      "C": "Duration of unconsciousness",
      "D": "Neurological lesions noted using an MRI",
      "E": "Duration of post-traumatic amnesia"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "There are several clinical indicators that predict severity of a head injury. They include duration of retrograde amnesia, the depth of unconsciousness as assessed by the worst score on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), the duration of coma, neurological evidence of cerebral injury, using an MRI or EEG, and the duration of post-traumatic amnesia. Of these, the least useful clinical indicator is the duration of retrograde amnesia. Duration of post-traumatic amnesia is the best marker of outcome. Patients with a post-traumatic amnesia of less than 1 week will have minimal disability, while duration of more than 1 month is suggestive of enduring and signifi cant disability. Other predictors of a bad outcome include previous head injury, older age, APOE e4 status, and alcohol dependence. Head injury can be classifi ed as mild wherein a GCS score of 13 to 15 is likely to be associated with only a short duration of loss of consciousness (less than 20 minutes) and a short post-traumatic amnesia (less than 24 hours). In moderate head injury, GCS score 9 to 12 is likely to be associated with loss of consciousness of more than a few minutes but less than 24 hours and a post-traumatic amnesia of more than 1 day but less than 1 week. In severe head injury, a GCS score 3 to 8 is likely to be associated with a loss of consciousness of more than 1 day or a post-traumatic amnesia of more than 1 week. Gelder MG et al., eds.

      "E": "There is no association between the presence of symptoms and compensatory claims"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The term post-concussion syndrome (PCS) is used to describe a cluster of symptoms that results in severe disability following mild head injury. There is no consistent relationship between the prevalence of PCS and the severity of head injury. Sometimes a similar constellation of symptoms may be seen in moderate and severe injury, where it is more likely to be attributed to the actual brain damage. Symptoms are usually vague, but early symptoms may include neurological complaints such as diplopia, dizziness, etc. Additional symptoms include cognitive impairment, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and irritability. In general, most neurological symptoms will have resolved by 2 to 6 months. Several observations support an organic basis, for example diffuse microscopic axonal injury on post mortem, macroscopic brain lesions evident in 8–10% of individuals on CT scan, subtle abnormalities on EEG, etc. Psychosocial factors play a part in the syndrome, especially in those lasting longer than 1 year. This is greatest in those with very mild head injuries and very chronic symptoms. There is an association between severity of post-concussion symptoms and seeking compensation, but very few improve even after the compensation. King NS.

    },
    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Anticonvulsants are not indicated at this point in time, especially since the patient has no symptoms suggestive of seizures. About 2 to 5% of all patients with mild, closed head injury tend to develop long-term seizure disorder. This rises to about 10 to 20% in patients with severe, closed head injury. A higher incidence of seizures has been seen in patients with depressed skull fractures (15%), haematomas (30%), and penetrating brain wounds (50%). Early seizures, within the fi rst week, are relatively benign and are only weak predictors of later epilepsy. This patient has a mild, closed injury, and he is at a low risk for developing seizures, despite positive family history. Randomized controlled studies have shown that the use of anticonvulsants does not prevent the development of post-traumatic epilepsy beyond the fi rst week after injury. There is a limited role for genetic predisposition in developing post-traumatic epilepsy. Those with the ApoE-ε4 allele may be at higher risk for post-traumatic epilepsy. Frey LC.

      "E": "There is no risk of triggering a relapse of neurological condition with ECT"
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient is most probably suffering from multiple sclerosis. The lifetime prevalence of major depression in multiple sclerosis (MS) is around 50%. It is three to 10 times the rate in the general population. Suicidal intent occurs in up to 30% of MS patients. This is linked to the presence and severity of depression and degree of social isolation. Suicide rates in MS patients are up to seven times higher than rates in the general population. Depression and suicide rates are higher in MS than in most other neurologic disorders. In MS patients, the lifetime prevalence of bipolar affective disorder is twice the prevalence in the general population. Pathological laughing and crying is a syndrome that presents with inappropriate laughter without associated happiness and inappropriate tears without associated sadness. Approximately 10% of MS patients are affected, with varying degrees of severity.

      "E": "Donepezil has not been found to be useful in improving memory in multiple sclerosis"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Around 50% of patients with MS have cognitive defi cits. Aphasia, apraxia, and agnosia, which are characteristic of predominantly cortical diseases, are generally absent in MS, where pathology is largely confi ned to subcortical white matter. Although patients with long-lasting and advanced physical disability may also have severe cognitive impairment, the correlation between cognitive dysfunction and disease characteristics (type and duration of MS) is usually weak or modest. Cognitive defi cits are also independent of mood symptoms in MS. Defi cits in working, semantic, and episodic memories have been reported. MS patients have diffi culty both in acquiring and in retrieving information (although performance on recognition tests is better than recall). Procedural memory is usually unaffected. Impaired attention and slowness of thinking is another feature of MS. Frontal lobe defi cits may take the form of defi cits in conceptualization and abstract thinking. At least one study has shown that donepezil is effective in improving cognitive defi cits in MS. Jefferies K. The neuropsychiatry of multiple sclerosis.

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Pathological laughter and crying is a symptom seen in MS, where approximately 10% of MS patients are affected, with varying degrees of severity. This is similar to descriptions of the pseudobulbar affect, although this symptom can be present without pseudobulbar palsy. Patients are more likely to have frontally mediated cognitive defi cits. Commonly used scales to identify and characterize this syndrome include the Pathological Laughter and Crying Scale and the Centre for Neurologic Study–Lability Scale. The most common differential diagnosis is a mood disorder, but patients with pathological crying exhibit the emotional display in the absence of a pervasive and sustained elation or depressed mood. But when mood disorder and pathological laughter and crying coexist, differentiation can be very diffi cult.

Seizures are convulsions that may be produced by a wide variety of events, including alcohol and drug withdrawal syndromes, hypoglycaemia, transient cerebral anoxia, and epileptic syndromes. Epilepsies are characterized by recurrent seizures and their classifi cation is based on seizure type, age of onset, intellectual development, fi ndings on neurological examination, and results of neuroimaging studies. Seizures are broadly classifi ed into partial and general forms. Partial seizures are further divided into simple and complex. In simple partial seizures consciousness is preserved; complex seizures are characterized by disturbances in consciousness. Partial seizures pertain to one half or one particular area of the brain. Generalized seizures involve both hemispheres from the beginning of the seizure but, at times, they may be secondary to spread from a partial seizure. Tonic–clonic seizures and absence seizures are examples of primary generalized seizures. They are usually associated with a loss of conscious awareness. Ropper AH and Brown RH, eds.

They are seizure-like behavioural events that occur in the absence of abnormal electrical discharge in the brain. The gold standard for diagnosis is video-EEG monitoring. People who present with non-epileptic seizures commonly have comorbid epilepsy. Nearly 30 to 50% of patients who have non-epileptic seizures have epilepsy and 20 to 60% of patients who have epilepsy have non-epileptic seizures. The average age of onset is between 20 and 30 years and it is three times more common in women than men. Prevalence rates of a history of sexual abuse in non-epileptic seizures range from 25 to 75%. An elevated prolactin level (usually two times baseline or three standard deviations above normal) could be due to seizures or any neurological event, such as syncope. Some patients with pseudoseizures may have modest elevations in prolactin levels. A normal prolactin may not always be diagnostic of pseudoseizures, since it is frequently normal in partial seizures and sampling may be mistimed following convulsions. Marcangelo MJ and Ovsiew F.

The inferior parietal lobe includes the upper part of the optic radiation which carries fi bres from upper half of the retina and hence lesions of this area produce inferior quadrantanopia. Parietal lobe damage also explains the hemineglect, mild hemiparesis, and dressing apraxia. Carotid artery syndrome usually presents with amaurosis fugax, the feature distinguishing it from the middle cerebral artery syndrome. Amaurosis fugax is transient, painless monocular blindness, usually due to emboli either from the large arteries or the heart itself. Occlusions of the coronaries usually occur at the bifurcation of the common carotid. Kasper DL et al., eds. Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 16th edn. McGraw-Hill, 2005, p. 2381"

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Stage 4 NREM sleep is characterized by more than 50% delta activity. When the delta activity ranges from 20 to 50%, the person is in stage 3 NREM sleep. K complexes and sleep spindles along with delta waves of less than 20% is noted in stage 2. Stage 2 is also the longest sleep stage through the night, comprising almost 50% of adult sleep. Stage 1 is characterized by gradual slowing of the alpha wave (less than 50% alpha activity). This is the sleep onset. Stage W (wakefulness) is characterized by predominantly alpha waves posteriorly with low voltage mixed frequency beta waves anteriorly. REM sleep constitutes around 20–25%. Normally, much less time is spent in stage W and stage 1. Hales RE and Yudofsky SC, eds. The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, 4th edn.

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient is likely to have narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a disorder of unknown aetiology. It consists of the tetrad of excessive day time sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations. Polysomnography typically shows sleep-onset REM stage. Cataplexy refers to sudden loss of muscular tone, often seen in association with emotional reactions in those with narcolepsy. An abnormality in the hypocretin neurones in the lateral hypothalamus has been noted in those with narcolepsy. Hypocretin (orexin) is a highly excitatory peptide hormone secreted from the hypothalamus. This is necessary to maintain wakefulness and it also increases appetite. Narcolepsy, especially cataplexy, is considered to be a hypocretin defi ciency syndrome. SSRIs and TCAs remain the treatment of choice currently. Modafi nil is also being tried as a treatment.

It is distinguished from Parkinson’s disease by the presence of early broad-based and stiff gait disorder (axial greater than limb rigidity in extension) with backward falls, and supranuclear gaze palsy with slow vertical saccades and diffi culty looking down (and hence the falls). Falls are very common in these patients and are an important cause of morbidity. Patients are prone to develop various psychiatric complications, including cognitive dysfunction and mood disorders. Cholinesterase inhibitors have not been particularly useful in treating patients with progressive supranuclear palsy associated dementia.

    "explanation": "Excessive stimulation of glutamate receptors leads to an increase in intraneuronal calcium and nitric oxide. Calcium activates proteases that could destroy the neurone from within. Memantine is an NMDA antagonist used in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, based on the excitotoxicity hypothesis. This mechanism may be applicable for Parkinson’s disease too. In Huntington’s disease, an expansion of the polyglutamine region of huntingtin takes place due to the disease-causing mutation. Hence the mutant huntingtin protein accumulates in the nuclei of neurones, preferentially in striatum and cortex. These aggregates may be directly toxic to some extent, but predominant striatal loss, as opposed to cortical loss, may be due to glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. Huntingtin accumulation may render cells unusually sensitive to glutamate-mediated damage. Ropper AH and Brown RH, eds. Adam and Victor’s Principles of Neurology, 8th edn. McGraw-Hill, 2005, p. 912"

    "explanation": "The age of the patient, the triad of memory diffi culties, loss of balance, and urinary incontinence, and the neuroimaging fi ndings suggest normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). NPH is not a hydrocephalus in the true sense—there is no increase in intracranial pressure when lumbar puncture is carried out. Following certain meningeal insults, secondary to subarachnoid haemorrhage, head trauma, or resolved meningitis, an increase in intracranial pressure may develop but reach a stable stage where formation of CSF diminishes and equilibrates with absorption, which increases proportionate to the pressure. Once this equilibrium is reached there must be a gradual fall in pressure, although at a high normal level. In some patients, this high normal intracranial pressure of 150 to 200 mm HO leads to manifestation of NPH. 2 Ropper AH and Brown RH, eds. Adam and Victor’s Principles of Neurology, 8th edn.

Both receptors bind to exogenously administered tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), present in marijuana. Anandamide (from the Sanskrit word ‘ananda’ for bliss) is chemically N-arachidonoylethanolamine (arachidonic acid and ethanolamine derivative). It is a weak endogenous cannabinoid ligand. 2-arachnidonylglycerol is a strong endogenous ligand for the cannabinoid receptor. Endogenous cannabinoids exhibit intraocular pressure-lowering effects.

    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Priapism is defi ned as a persistent penile erection greater than 4 hours in duration, which is unrelated to sexual stimulation or desire. Roughly 40 to 50% of patients who develop priapism become impotent, even after surgical treatment. Drug-induced priapism accounts for 15–40% of all cases. Psychotropics associated with priapism include trazodone, phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone, and clozapine. Priapism results from decreased venous outfl ow from the corpora cavernosa of the penis. This can be caused by obstruction of the venous system, for example by blood dyscrasias such as sickle cell anaemia or by blocking the sympathetically mediated (α receptor) detumescence. Hence the ability of a drug to block α receptors 1 1 correlates with its risk of priapism. This is especially true if the antiadrenergic effect is unopposed by an equally strong anticholinergic effect. Sympathetic tone is related to detumescence while parasympathetic tone is related to erection. For drugs with combined antiadrenergic and anticholinergic activity, when antiadrenergic activity negates detumescence, the anticholinergic activity will negate erection and so priapism will be rare.

Metabotropic receptors aside, most glutamate receptors (NMDA, AMPA, and kainate) are ionotropic and allow Ca2+ transit (NMDA, AMPA) or Na+, K+ transit (kainate) via ligand-gated channels.

    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "In depression, hypercortisolism is seen in a subgroup of patients. This can be demonstrated by the dexamethasone suppression test wherein exogenously administered steroid dexamethasone fails to activate the negative feedback loop to reduce endogenous cortisol. Depressed patients also show blunted TSH response when thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) is injected. A brisk GH release seen on apomorphine/levodopa challenge is absent in some patients with depression. This suggests dopaminergic dysfunction in a subgroup. Clomipramine challenge in normal subjects leads to increased serotonergic activation and prolactin release. This prolactin response to clomipramine-mediated via serotonin is blunted in depression. Psychotic depression shows more HPA axis disturbance than non-psychotic depression. Melancholic (somatic syndrome) depression increases the chance of fi nding endocrine disturbances among depressed patients. Gelder M, López-Ibor J, and Andreasen N.

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Wilson’s disease is also known as hepatolenticular degeneration. It is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The abnormal gene (ATP7B) is located in chromosome 13. Ceruloplasmin is an α globulin that normally carries 90% of the copper present in the plasma. 2 In Wilson’s disease, ceruloplasmin fails to bind copper and its excretion by the liver is impaired. The excess copper accumulates fi rst in the liver and then in the brain (especially putamen and pallidus) and other tissues. In the early stages of the disease, proliferation of large protoplasmic astrocytes, such as Opalski cells and Alzheimer cells, occurs. Deposition of copper in Descemet’s membrane in the cornea leads to the appearance of the golden-brown ‘Kayser–Fleischer’ (KF) ring. The main neurological abnormalities are rigidity, dystonia, chorea, athetosis, dysarthria, and tremor. It is considered that a pure psychiatric presentation occurs in 20–25% of cases. Around 50% of patients will have mental disturbances at some point during the course of the disease. Psychiatric manifestations tend to occur more commonly with neurological forms of Wilson’s disease than with the hepatic form of the clinical syndrome. Cognitive impairment occurs in up to 25% of patients. The dementia is usually subcortical type with frontal defi cits. Depression occurs in 30% of cases and suicidal behaviour may occur in between 4 and 16%. Ring HA, and Serra-Mestres J. Neuropsychiatry of the basal ganglia.

      "E": "Thiamine defi ciency is the most important mediator of neuronal damage seen in fetalalcohol syndrome"
    },
    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "It has been postulated that exposure of the brain to alcohol during the period of rapid synaptogenesis (third trimester) leads to apoptosis and neuronal loss, especially in thalamic and basal ganglia area. Since this change is apoptotic, it does not lead to fi brous scarring. This apoptotic cell death has been postulated to be due to the action of alcohol on the NMDA and GABA receptors. Apparently, large quantities of alcohol taken during a short period of time, even once, as in a binge episode, can lead to these changes. The cluster of symptoms also depends on the timing of alcohol exposure, so if the exposure occurred during the fi rst trimester it would lead to facial abnormalities. In addition to developing hyperactivity/attention defi cit disorder and varying degrees of learning impairment in children, a high percentage have adult-onset neuropsychiatric disturbances, including major depression and psychosis.

    "explanation": "Cauda equina syndrome is characterized by low back pain (radicular pain), asymmetric weakness, arefl exia, and sensory loss in the legs, and relative sparing of bowel and bladder function. The syndrome usually results from injury of multiple lumbosacral nerve roots within the spinal canal. Most commonly, this is due to a ruptured lumbosacral intervertebral disc (disc prolapse). Less common causes include lumbosacral spine fracture, haematoma within the spinal canal, and compressive tumours. Cauda equine must be differentiated from conus medullaris syndrome, which includes compression of the lower sacral and coccygeal segments. This results in bilateral saddle anaesthesia, prominent bladder and bowel dysfunction, and impotence.

    "correct_answer": "D",

Skin and nervous system develops from the ectoderm, the gut from the endoderm, and all other visceral organs from the mesoderm. After gastrulation, the notochord is formed from mesodermal cells. This notochord lies rostro caudally and it sends signals to the ectoderm lying adjacent to it, transforming them into neurectoderm. This forms the neuronal stem cells in the embryo. This strip of ectoderm is otherwise called the neuronal plate. By the third week of gestation, a groove develops on the dorsal aspect of the neural plate and this groove gradually deepens, forming neuronal folds. These folds gradually close bidirectionally by the end of the fourth week, forming the neural tube. Closure of the neural tube is susceptible to teratogenic infl uences operating in fi rst trimester (e.g. valproate). Ramachandran VS, ed. Encyclopedia of the Human Brain, Vol. 3.

    },
    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The vestibulocochlear nerve is purely sensory. It has two components, the vestibular and the cochlear, both of which are sensory. The vestibular component transmits information on position and balance received from the semicircular canals and the cochlear component serves the sense of hearing. The hypoglossal nerve innervates the ipsilateral side of the tongue. It is a purely motor efferent nerve. In unilateral lower motor neurone palsy of the eight nerve, when protruded, the tongue deviates toward the side of weakness. The trochlear nerve is unique among cranial nerves in that it decussates to the contralateral side and its point of exit is through the dorsal surface of the brain. The trochlear nerve thus innervates the superior oblique muscle of the contralateral eye. It is a purely efferent nerve. The facial nerve innervates the muscles of the face. It has a sensory component, innervating the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, via the chorda tympani. Facial nerve palsy causes deviation of the angle of mouth to the normal side. As a mnemonic, ‘the rule of 17’ applies to deviations in cranial nerve palsies. Palsy of tenth (vagus and hence palate) and seventh (facial) nerve leads to deviation to the normal side. Palsy of the fi fth (trigeminal and hence the jaw muscles) and twelfth (hypoglossal, tongue) nerve leads to deviation to the paralytic side. Ramachandran VS, ed.

    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The pathway that enables normal vision starts from rods and cones in the retina, which are receptors of the ganglion cells. The axons of ganglion cells extend as the optic nerve, through the optic chiasma, via the optic tract, and synapse at the lateral geniculate body of thalamus. From the lateral geniculate body, second-order neurones go through the optic radiation to the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. In contrast, the pathway constituting the papillary light refl ex digresses from the visual pathway before it joins the lateral geniculate body to reach the dorsal midbrain. They synapse at the pretectal nuclei, from where second-order neurones go to the Edinger–Westphal nucleus on both sides. Edinger–Westphal nuclei, via the third nerve, control the pupillary constrictors that constitute the response to light. So, pupillary light refl ex do not involve the occipital cortex. Hence even in those with cortical blindness due to bilateral occipital cortex damage, light refl ex may be intact. Brazis P et al. Localisation in Clinical Neurology, 5th edn.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The hypoglossal nerve is a purely somatic motor nerve. The autonomic nervous system has two parts, the sympathetic and parasympathetic. Sympathetic output from the CNS is mainly through thoracic and lumbar spinal nerves. Sympathetic preganglionic nerves are short and form synapses in paired ganglia adjacent to the spinal cord. The parasympathetic system has a craniosacral output, that is it operates through some cranial nerves and sacral spinal nerves. These have long preganglionic nerves which form synapses at ganglia near or on the organ innervated. Among the cranial nerves, the vagus is the chief parasympathetic nerve. It supplies parasympathetic efferents to heart and most of the abdominal viscera and the gastrointestinal tract, but oculomotor (III), facial (VII), and glossopharyngeal nerves (IX) also carry parasympathetic fi bres. The neurotransmitter at the preganglionic nerve ending is acetylcholine in both sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. At the post ganglionic nerve ending, the neurotransmitter is acetylcholine in the parasympathetic system and mostly norepinephrine in the sympathetic system. Ramachandran VS, ed.

Generally, they are considered to have opposing actions. The sympathetic system is activated in emergency situations, where the body requires more energy. This response includes increased cardiac output, dilatation of bronchioles, routing blood to the muscles, glycogen and fat breakdown leading to a rise in the blood glucose and fatty acids, and slowing down of digestion and renal fi ltration. This also leads to a decrease in gastrointestinal secretion and motility (leading to dryness of the mouth). In addition, sympathetic activity causes constriction of bladder and bowel sphincters and relaxation of the smooth muscles of the viscera. The pupils dilate due to action on the dilators. In contrast, parasympathetic stimulation leads to pupillary constriction and accommodation for close vision, reduces heart rate, constricts bronchioles, and increases gastrointestinal secretions with relaxation of sphincters. Parasympathetic stimulation is necessary for erection and sympathetic stimulation for ejaculation. Ganong WF. Review of Medical Physiology, 22nd edn. McGraw-Hill, 2005, p. 229"

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The posterior column is responsible for transmission of proprioception, light touch, tactile localization, and vibration senses. Posterior column dysfunction can result in disturbances in the knowledge of extremity movement and position. This presents as sensory ataxia (noted fi rst in the dark as visual input does not compensate for the lost position sense) and a positive Romberg’s sign. Pain and temperature is transmitted to the central nervous system through the spinothalamic tract. Spinothalamic tracts cross over two segments above the level of entry of the root at the spinal cord. Posterior column tracts cross over only at the midbrain level, where they synapse with the cuneate and gracilis nuclei. Hence, if hemisection of the cord takes place, ipsilateral posterior column senses are lost below the level of section; contralateral spinothalamic sensations are lost from two levels below the site of section.

      "E": "Subthalamic nucleus"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The term basal ganglia traditionally applied to fi ve large, subcortical nuclear masses on each side of the brain: the caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and substantia nigra. The globus pallidus is further divided into an external and an internal segment, and the substantia nigra is divided into a pars compacta and a pars reticulata. The caudate nucleus and the putamen are frequently called the striatum; the putamen and the globus pallidus are sometimes called the lenticular nucleus. The nucleus accumbens is the region where the putamen and the caudate merge anteriorly. What structures comprise the basal ganglia has been a debate over the years. More recently, an additional term, ‘ventral striatum’ has been introduced to describe those parts of the striatum (caudate and putamen) closest to limbic structures and that are involved in cognitive and behavioural functions. The ventral striatum includes the nucleus accumbens, which plays a major role in motivational and reward-related behaviour. Amygdala is closely related to the basal ganglia due to its functional and structural proximity. The amygdala complex develops from the same tissue mass as the caudate nucleus.

    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Horner’s syndrome is caused by sympathetic dysfunction at the craniocervical output. Clinical features include ipsilateral mild (usually <2 mm) ptosis, anisocoria (unequal pupils) due to ipsilateral miosis, enophthalmos, loss of ciliospinal refl ex, and ipsilateral facial anhidrosis (mnemonic ‘PAMELA’). Nystagmus is generally not seen. Nystagmus is a rhythmical oscillation of the eyes, occurring pathologically in a wide variety of diseases. Abnormalities of the eyes or optic nerves, especially when the onset is in childhood, may present with nystagmus (pendular or jerk nystagmus). Jerk nystagmus is characterized by a slow drift off the target, followed by a fast corrective saccade. Jerk nystagmus can be downbeat, upbeat, or horizontal (left or right) with the names being given according to the direction of the fast phase. Gaze-evoked nystagmus is the most common form of jerk nystagmus, where the subject is asked to look to the corner of the eye. Exaggerated gaze-evoked nystagmus can be seen in: drug intake/toxicity (sedatives, anticonvulsants, alcohol); muscle paresis; myasthenia gravis; demyelinating disease; and cerebellopontine angle, brainstem, and cerebellar lesions. Downbeat nystagmus usually occurs from lesions near the craniocervical junction, while upbeat nystagmus is associated with damage to the pontine tegmentum, from stroke, demyelination, or tumour. Vestibular system dysfunction also leads to nystagmus. This occurs in discrete attacks, usually associated with sudden movements of the head and is accompanied by symptoms of nausea, tinnitus, hearing loss, and vertigo. Kasper DL et al., eds.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The cholinergic nicotinic receptor forms the prototypical model for ionotropic receptors. It is a heteromeric pentameric protein, and each subunit is a transmembrane protein with four transmembrane domains (in total 20 transmembrane domains compared to seven in the case of metabotropic receptors). Binding of a neurotransmitter to the extracellular domain of the ionic receptor results in the brief opening of a transmembrane ionic pore. This leads to an infl ux of certain ions, which produces a brief modifi cation of the resting membrane potential. This results in a postsynaptic action potential. Muscarinic acetyl choline receptors are not ionotropic; they are G-protein coupled and act via second messengers. GABA not GABA is an ion channel A B receptor.

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The exact mechanisms of action of LSD and other hallucinogens are not completely understood as yet, but there is substantial evidence pointing towards serotonergic systems in the brain. Receptor-binding studies have shown that radiolabelled LSD binds to 5-HT and 5-HT 2A 1C receptors. Hallucinogens have agonist actions at the 5-HT receptor. The psychoactive and 2A behavioural effects of hallucinogens are blocked by 5-HT antagonists. Tolerance/tachyphylaxis 2A of hallucinogenic effect is related to down-regulation of 5-HT receptors. There may be a role 2A for 5-HT receptors too in mediating the actions of hallucinogens. LSD is only a partial agonist 2C at 5-HT , in contrast to the full agonist actions of other hallucinogens. The 5-HT receptor 2A 2A potentiates glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission when activated, while activating the inhibitory GABA interneurone system.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Neurotrophins comprise a family of proteins including nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophins (NT)-3, -4/5, and -6. Proneurotrophins are enzymatically processed to create mature neurotrophins. Neurotrophins bind to specifi c tyrosine kinase receptors. Neurotrophins promote neuronal growth, differentiation, and survival, and modulate synaptic plasticity. These growth-related effects result from the interaction of neurotrophins with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway and the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase pathway. In addition, the neurotrophins can inhibit cell death cascades. Reduced expression of neurotrophins such as BDNF has been proposed to underlie defi cits in hippocampal neurogenesis seen in animal models of depression. Chronic antidepressant treatments are shown to upregulate neurotrophin expression, mediating relief from depression. Neurotrophin-mediated proliferation of hippocampal cells may be one of the fi nal common pathways of antidepressant effects. Fatemi HS and Clayton PJ. Medical Basis of Psychiatry.

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "L-tyrosine is an amino acid derived from food proteins. It is also derived from the catabolism of phenylalanine in the liver by phenylalanine hydroxylase. L-tyrosine forms the precursor for the catecholamine neurotransmitters. Dopamine is the major initial product derived from L-tyrosine. Dopamine hydroxylase further converts dopamine into norepinephrine. In cells that contain phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), norepinephrine undergoes further processing via methylation to produce epinephrine. Epinephrine is formed in trivial amounts in the CNS but is a major product in the adrenal medulla. Any drug that enhances the action of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine hydroxylase is likely to enhance noradrenergic transmission.

For the signal to get across to the postsynaptic neurone, it must be transformed into an intraneuronal message. This is enabled via formation of the ‘second-messenger’ molecules. Second messengers generally do not act outside the cell of origin. The most commonly encountered second messengers include cAMP and cGMP, the calcium ion (Ca2+), and the phosphoinositol metabolites such as inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Gases such as nitric oxide and carbon monoxide also act as intraneuronal second-messenger molecules. The second messengers are not hormones as they do not reach tissues via the blood stream. Unlike receptor proteins, they do not combine with the neurotransmitter molecules directly. They are present throughout the CNS. Sadock BJ and Sadock VA.

The lifetime prevalence is about 1 in 60 in the UK. It is most commonly seen between the ages of 15 and 45, in both men and women. Pregnancy and diabetes may increase the risk of Bell’s palsy substantially. Though the exact cause is not known, a viral aetiology is suspected (herpesvirus). The symptoms usually develop overnight. Most patients present with diffi culty closing the eye, drooling of saliva, and sagging of the eyebrow on one side. Less commonly, patients may have heightened sensitivity to loud noise on the affected side. Most patients (nearly 80%) recover completely within 3 weeks. Almost all patients recover within 6 months. Patients with Bell’s palsy exhibit Bell’s phenomenon. Bell’s phenomenon is a normal defence refl ex present in about 75% of the population. It results in elevation of the globes when shutting eyes closed or when the eyes are directly threatened by external agents. Such upward movement helps to protect the most important structures (cornea and lens) of one’s eyes. This elevation becomes noticeable when the orbicularis muscle becomes weak as in Bell’s palsy. Bilateral Bell’s phenomenon is found in myasthenia gravis, sarcoidosis, bilateral Bell’s palsies, congenital facial diplegia, some rare forms of muscular dystrophy, motor neurone disease, and Guillain–Barré syndrome.

      "E": "Serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Serotonergic cells are localized in the brainstem in a group of nuclei called the raphe nuclei. In contrast to the more circumscribed dopaminergic pathways, almost all parts of the brain receive serotonergic input. This probably explains the multiple effects of serotonin receptors on mood and behaviour. All serotonin receptors are G-protein linked, except 5-HT which is ligand gated. Serotonin does not cross the blood–brain barrier and thus the 3 brain synthesizes its own serotonin. This is in turn determined by concentrations of free plasma tryptophan and transport across the blood–brain barrier. This forms the basis of the rapid tryptophan depletion test. Tryptophan hydroxylase hydroxylates tryptophan to 5-hydroxy tryptophan (5-HTP), which is further decarboxylated to serotonin (5-HT) by aromatic-L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) in the presence of vitamin B as coenzyme. The rate-limiting step 6 in serotonin synthesis is considered to be the availability of 5-HTP. In parallel with dopamine and norepinephrine, following release into the synaptic cleft, 5-HT is either metabolized or actively transported back into the neurone by a high-affi nity transporter, the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT). SERT is encoded by a single gene on chromosome 17. The SERT gene has been recently postulated to play an important role in gene–environment interaction in disorders such as depression. Gillette R.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Prion protein (PrP) is a glycoprotein anchored to neuronal cell membranes. The normal function of prion protein is not known. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (‘mad cow disease’) and Crutzfeldt–Jakob disease are associated with altered prion proteins. In prion diseases, the normal cellular form of PrP (called PrPC) undergoes transformation to an altered version (called scrapie-associated prion protein PrPSc). The latter accumulates in the brain to form insoluble aggregates, leading to neuronal dysfunction, but unlike other neurodegenerative diseases, prion diseases are transmissible. This is made possible because PrPSc imprints its pathological conformation onto other, normal PrPC molecules, thus ‘converting’ them to be abnormal.

    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The establishment and maintenance of a wakeful state is called arousal. In humans, arousal activity requires at least three brain regions. The most important of these is the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS). ARAS may have a role in setting the level of consciousness. ARAS, via the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus, project widely throughout the cerebral cortex. A synchronized, rhythmic burst of neuronal activity (20–40 Hz frequency) results from ARAS and thalamic coordination. The degree of synchronization varies directly with the level of wakefulness. During sleep the synchronicity is lost. The third most important region in arousal state is the right frontal lobe. The right frontal lobe is essential for the ‘maintenance’ of attention; this is evident when testing letter-cancellation tasks or trail-making tasks in patients with right frontal lesions.

    },
    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Hodgkin and Huxley showed that the inside of a cell, such as a neurone, is negatively charged compared to the outside. This is called the resting membrane potential and its value ranges between −40 mV and −90 mV (average −70 mV), depending on the type of cell. This negative resting membrane potential arises due to the membranes of the resting neurone being more permeable to potassium ions than to any other ions. There are more potassium ions inside the cell than outside it, which is due to a constant outward leak creating a negative potential inside the cell. An action potential is initiated in the axon hillock when the synaptic signals received by the dendrites and soma are suffi cient to raise the intracellular potential from −70 mV to the threshold potential of −55 mV. When this potential is reached, the Na+ channels, which are dormant at rest, will open. This Na+ infl ux causes rapid reversal of the membrane potential from −70 to +40 mV. Ramachandran VS, ed.

Glycine acts on a chloride channel that is different from GABA receptors, called the strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor. A On activation, the transmembrane glycine receptors facilitate entry of chloride ion into the cell, leading to hyperpolarization of the cell. Glycine is synthesized from serine; this conversion is mediated by rate-limiting steps via serine trans-hydroxymethylase and glycerate dehydrogenase. Glycine also serves as an obligatory neurotransmitter adjunct for glutamate activity on the NMDA glutamate receptors (non-strychnine-sensitive glycine site). Some clinical trials have shown a reduction in the negative symptoms of schizophrenia using D-serine or glycine mediated via NMDA receptors, though this has not been widely replicated.

      "A": "Single photon emission computed tomography",
      "B": "Computed tomography with radiocontrast",
      "C": "Positron emission tomography",
      "D": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Positron emission tomography (PET) is considered as the gold standard of functional neuroimaging modalities. Among other available techniques, only PET can measure cerebral glucose metabolism directly. In addition, a large number of radioligands for receptor characterization are available for PET. Despite these advantages, PET is not widely available due to the expensive nature of the equipment; it requires relatively rapid access to a cyclotron to produce the positron-emitting radionuclides.

      "C": "Stage 3 and 4 NREM sleep",
      "D": "All stages of sleep",
      "E": "Upon awakening"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Most hormones show a diurnal–nocturnal variation in their plasma levels. This is partly related to circadian mechanisms and hypothalamic functions. Level of physical activity and diurnal change in metabolic requirements may also infl uence the hormonal levels in blood. Growth hormone regulates carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. There is a nocturnal surge of growth hormone seen during slow wave sleep (stage 3 and 4 NREM sleep). Speculative association of growth hormone surge and memory consolidation has not been borne out by experimental results. Gais S, Hüllemann P, Hallschmid M et al. Sleep-dependent surges in growth hormone do not contribute to sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Psychoneuroendocrinology 2006; 31: 786–791"

Hegives a history of polyuria and confusion with visual fi eld defects. Onexamination he appears to be signifi cantly shorter than average height forhis age. He does not have signs of meningitis. His past medical history andfamily history reveals no additional clues to his presentation. He deniesusing drugs. Which of the following investigations may help in clinching thediagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "CSF analysis",
      "B": "Electroencephalogram",
      "C": "CT brain scan",
      "D": "Neuropsychological testing",
      "E": "Urine drug screen"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The presentation here is consistent with craniopharyngioma. It is a benign, slow- growing tumour involving the pituitary gland. The clinical presentation is usually insidious with the most common presenting symptoms being headache, endocrine dysfunction, and visual fi eld disturbances. The headache may be positional and slowly progressive. Hypothyroidism, adrenal failure, and diabetes insipidus are the common endocrine disturbances noted. Young patients may have growth failure and/or delayed puberty. Visual fi eld defects are due to pressure effects on the optic nerve route. Bitemporal hemianopia is the most common problem due to pressure at the chiasma. The anatomic location of the craniopharyngioma may be classifi ed into prechiasmal (associated with optic atrophy), retrochiasmal (associated with signs of increased intracranial pressure such as papilledema), or intrasellar (associated with headache and endocrine dysfunction). The diagnosis is strongly suggested by imaging studies. The appearance of a suprasellar or intrasellar calcifi ed cyst is considered to be the radiological hallmark. CT scan is the most sensitive method as calcifi cations are easily picked up as high-density areas. MRI is very helpful for neurosurgeons to plan a surgical approach. Ropper AH and Brown RH, eds.

      "A": "Alar plate",
      "B": "C cells of thyroid",
      "C": "Isthumus of thyroid",
      "D": "Neural tube",
      "E": "Rathke’s pouch"
    },
    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The embryogenetic theory of craniopharyngioma suggests the involvement of Rathke’s pouch. The infundibulum is a downward projection of diencephalon; the Rathke’s pouch is an upward elongation of the primitive oral cavity. Rathke’s pouch and the infundibulum develop during the fourth week of gestation and grow towards each other until they unite to form the hypophysis of the pituitary gland during the second month. The remnants of Rathke’s pouch involute into a cleft and disappear completely in normal conditions. In some cases, this Rathke’s cleft remnant can become the site of origin of craniopharyngiomas. Alar plate is related to development of the spinal cord. Isthumus of thyroid is related to thyroglossal duct. Ropper AH and Brown RH, eds. Adams and Victor’s Principles of Neurology, 8th edn.

      "D": "Right subthalamic nucleus",
      "E": "Right thalamus"
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The patient described in Question 133 has an acute onset of fl inging movements of one side of the body. This is called hemiballism. Movements are usually involuntary, wide amplitude, and irregular with no pattern or rhythm. They commonly involve the arm and leg together; facial involvement has been reported in about half of the cases. Movements are increased with action, decreased with relaxation, and absent during sleep. In some patients the movements can cause physical exhaustion or injury of the affected limb. Hemiballism is considered to be primarily a disorder of the contralateral subthalamic nuclei (STN), but recently lesions outside STN have been demonstrated in patients with hemiballism. It is noted that the hemiballism caused by lesions of the STN is more severe than that caused by lesions elsewhere. Posturna RB and Lang AE. Hemiballism: revisiting a classic disorder.

    "question": "Phineas Gage is a celebrated case in neuropsychiatry. This 25-year-oldrailroad foreman sustained an extraordinary brain injury after which hehad a signifi cant change in his personality characterized by childishness,stubborn, and obstinate behaviour with frequent use of profanities. Whichof the following brain regions was damaged signifi cantly to result in thispresentation?",

      "A": "Inferior parietal cortex",
      "B": "Superior temporal cortex",

      "D": "Hippocampus",
      "E": "Hypothalamus"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The cardinal function of prefrontal cortex is planning and organization of behaviour (executive function) in addition to functions of short-term memory, motor attention, and inhibitory control. The change in Gage’s personality would be consistent with damage to the orbitofrontal cortex of the ventral aspect of his frontal lobe, affecting affect and emotion. A pseudopsychopathic syndrome, characterized by impulsivity and socially inappropriate behaviour, is recognized in orbitofrontal damage. Inferior parietal cortex may play a role in attention and body image function. The primary function of superior temporal cortex is auditory processing. The hippocampus is the seat of episodic memory; lesions can result in amnesia. The hypothalamus is involved in appetitive behaviours such as hunger, thirst, and sex.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Mononeuritis multiplex is a form of peripheral neuropathy wherein axonal destruction occurs in different sites leading to sensory and motor defi cits. The nerves involved are generally multiple and random with no predictability of progression. This acute or subacute involvement of multiple individual nerves may be serial or even simultaneous. It is not a single disease but a syndrome caused by various disorders; often the fi nal common pathway includes vascular damage to neurones. Nearly one-third of cases are idiopathic. The most common identifi able cause in adults is diabetes mellitus, followed by vasculitis syndromes such as polyarteritis nodosa and connective tissue diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. In children and adolescents, the most common cause of mononeuritis multiplex is connective tissue disease. Mononeuritis multiplex can mimic conversion disorder and present to psychiatric units.

      "E": "Stroop Test"
    },
    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The question describes the classic form of the Stroop Colour–Word Test. In this test the subject is initially required to read names of some basic colours. Later the subject is asked to name the colours of geometrical shapes. Following this, the test of interference is applied. Looking at a colour name written in a different colour produces a confl ict; this makes the subject read the name instead of saying the colour in which it is written, for example if the word ‘blue’ is written in green the subject tends to say blue, even when asked to name the displayed colour. The classic form of the Stroop Colour–Word Test is the most commonly used, though variations such as Emotional Stroop are now available. Rorschach’s is a projective test which uses ink-blot images. The Continuous Performance Test measures sustained/selective attention and impulsivity. Goldfarb L and Henik A. New data analysis of the stroop matching task calls for a reevaluation of theory.

    "question": "Which of the following is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis ofdopamine?",

      "A": "Tyrosine hydroxylase",
      "B": "DOPA decarboxylase",
      "C": "Dopamine hydroxylase",
      "D": "Monoamine oxydase",
      "E": "Catechol-O-methyl transferase"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Dopamine is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine. Initially, tyrosine is converted to L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) by tyrosine hydroxylase (the rate-limiting step). L-DOPA is rapidly converted to dopamine by dopa decarboxylase. Dopamine is stored in vesicles and 80% of the released dopamine is rapidly transported back into the nerve terminal by a dopamine-specifi c transporter (DAT). This intracellular extravesicular dopamine is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO) to dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC). Twenty percent of the released dopamine is sequentially degraded extracellularly by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO to 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT) and homovanillic acid (HVA). Dopaminergic cell bodies in the brain are mainly localized in the ventral tegmental area in the brainstem. There are predominantly four pathways that are considered to be dopaminergic in the brain: mesocortical and mesolimbic axons originate from the VTA and project to the prefrontal cortex and limbic structures, respectively; the tuberoinfundibular pathway mediates release of prolactin from the pituitary; and the nigrostriate pathway forms an integral part of the basal ganglion extrapyramidal system.

    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Parkinsonian tremor is usually of large amplitude with a frequency of 4 to 6 cycles per second. It is a resting tremor which persists even during action. Parkinsonian tremor is not reduced by alcohol but is exaggerated in stressful situations. In contrast, benign essential tremor is usually of smaller amplitude and higher frequency (10 to 12 cycles per second). It is often seen during action and may be unnoticeable during rest. It is exacerbated by stress, similar to Parkinsonian tremor. Clinically, essential tremor is similar to exaggerated physiological tremor. Cummings JL and Trimble M.

A CT scan is not 100% sensitive in ruling out possible intracranial bleed. Given the high clinical suspicion, the gold standard test for SAH, lumbar puncture, must be carried out. Presence of depression must not distract one from considering acute medical causes of somatic complaints such as headaches. Haloperidol is not indicated in this scenario.
