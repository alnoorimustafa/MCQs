    },
    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Neuroglial cells surround the neurons providing them with support and protection. They play a significant role in phagocytosis and myelin production. Neuroglial cells are of two main types known as microglia and macroglia. Microglia are specialised macrophages found in the central nervous system (CNS) whereas macroglia are found in both CNS and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Schwann cell s, satellite cells and enteric glial cells are macroglia found in the PNS. Astrocytes, ependymal cells, oligodendrocytes and radial glial cells are macroglia found in the CNS. The most abundant type of macroglia in the PNS is the Schwann cells. However, overall, the most abundant type of macroglia is astrocytes."

    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Ionisation of drugs is largely dependent on the pH of the solution. It affects the absorption, distribution and elimination of drugs in the body. Antipsychotics are not highly ionised at physiological pH. In general, most psychotropic drugs are easily absorbed from the gut and they pass from the plasma to the brain due to their lipophilic property. Most of them are metabolised in the liver and are affected by first-pass metabolism. They are largely bound to proteins in the plasma, but only plasma-free fractions are pharmacologically active."

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Total body water and lean body mass decrease in old age, whereas total body fat increases. This leads to an increase in volume of distribution (Vd) for lipid-soluble drugs but a decreased Vd for water-soluble drugs. Receptor sensitivity may increase in old age, leading to increased effects of the drugs. Due to delayed gastric emptying and slow motility, absorption is usually slowed down but just as complete. The albumin level decreases so the proportion of free or unbound drug increases. Half-lives are usually prolonged."

    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This is metabolised by the cytochrome P450 CYP450-2D6 into its active metabolite, paliperidone. Therefore, paliperidone itself is not a substrate for this enzyme. All the other antipsychotics mentioned in the question are metabolised by this enzyme. Therefore, in theory, their dose should be reduced when a CYP450-2D6 inhibitor (e.g. fluoxetine, paroxetine, duloxetine) is administered concomitantly. In the case of risperidone, it increases the risk of extrapyramidal side effects. Paliperidone injection is indicated for maintenance in patients with schizophrenia who had previously responded to risperidone or paliperidone tablets."

It also converts venlafaxine into its active metabolite, desvenlafaxine. Paroxetine, duloxetine and fluoxetine are its potent inhibitors whereas other SSRIs, reboxetine and bupropion are among its weak inhibitors. Answers: MCQs 29 Concomitant administration of TCAs and SSRIs may require a dose reduction of TCAs. Concomitant administration of CYP450-2D6 inhibitors can also interfere with the analgesic effect of codeine."

    "question": "Which of the following statements explains the mechanism of action of sildenafil?",
    "options": {
      "A": "By inducing the enzyme phosphodiesterase V, it raises the levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)",
      "B": "By inducing the enzyme phosphodiesterase V, it reduces the levels of cGMP",
      "C": "By inhibiting the enzyme phosphodiesterase V, it raises the levels of cGMP",
      "D": "By inhibiting the enzyme phosphodiesterase V, it reduces the levels of cGMP",
      "E": "By inhibiting the enzyme phosphodiesterase V, it has no effect on the levels of cGMP"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Normally cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) causes smooth muscle relaxation, resulting in a physiological erection. The cGMP is broken down in the penis by phosphodiesterase-V enzyme. Sildenafil inhibits the enzyme, so helping the levels of cGMP to build up in the penis, leading to an erection. A desire to have sex is essential for sildenafil to work, meaning that it will not work during sleep."

      "D": "Selective binding to the g subunit of GABA-C receptors",
      "E": "Selective binding to the Z subunit of GABA-A receptors"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "There are three types of g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors: GABA-A, GABA-B and GABA-C. GABA-A receptors have different subtypes depending on the subunits: α (1–6), β (1–3), γ (1–3), δ, ε, π, Ω and ρ (1–3). Zopiclone, eszopiclone and benzodiazepines bind to α1, α2, α3 and α5 subunits of GABA-A receptors. Alpha-1 subtype is critical for sedation and is also linked to daytime sedation, anticonvulsant action and amnesia. Zaleplon and zolpidem are selective to the α1-subtype and so have less risk of tolerance and dependence."

      "E": "There is significant down-regulation of MARCKS with repeated use of carbamazepine"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This is an abbreviation for myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) protein. Recent studies show that the mood-stabilising effect of mood stabilisers are attributed to the effect of medication on MARCKS. It has been noticed that with use of sodium valproate and lithium there is a significant down-regulation of MARCKS expression. Carbamazepine lacks this effect, indicating that the mechanism of mood stabilisation of carbamazepine is different to that of lithium or sodium valproate."

      "E": "Its use with alcohol can lead to decreased levels of acetaldehyde in the blood"
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Alcohol is metabolised by alcohol dehydrogenase, which is further metabolised by aldehyde dehydrogenase.

Many of the somatic cells go through cell division via the process of mitosis, which is a form of nuclear division. Meiosis is a special form of cell division for sexual reproduction. Mitosis consists of the following stages: 1. Interphase: before a cell enters into mitosis it goes into a growth period called interphase. 2. Prophase: it is a stage in which chromatin condenses into chromosomes.3. Metaphase: it is a stage in which chromosomes get aligned on metaphase plate.4. Anaphase: in this stage paired chromosomes separate and move to the opposite ends of the cell. 5. Telophase: it is in this stage that division of the cytoplasm begins."

Twin and adoption studies are the methods of choice for finding out relative contribution of both gene and environment on development. Adoption studies largely consider the impact of environment on the development of a child who has been adopted into a family. Heritability is described as what proportion of observed trait in individuals is due to genetic differences. It is mainly studied by conduction family and twin studies. A family study is conducted basically to answer the question: 'Is the phenotype familial?' Linkage analysis answers the question, 'Where the genes located?' Association analysis helps to find out, 'what the responsible genes are.'"

    "explanation": "It is the first step of gene expression in which information from the DNA molecule is transcribed onto an RNA transcript. This process takes place in the nucleus of the cell and consists of five steps: preinitiation, initiation, promoter clearance, elongation and termination. Translation is the process of making proteins from the RNA molecule and takes place in the cytoplasm with the help of ribosomes. Replication, as the name suggests, is a process in which the DNA or genetic material produces a duplicate copy of itself. Modification is a change in phenotype, which is influenced by environmental factors and is not a heritable trait."
