    "explanation": "Polymorphism refers to variations in the genome at a particular locus noted in a general, apparently healthy population. Polymorphisms occur at a fairly high frequency in the general population. When the polymorphism occurs in more than 1% of a population, it can be considered as useful for genetic linkage analysis. ABO blood groups are a good example of polymorphism expressed in the protein products of genes. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms are those variations that create or destroy the sites at which restriction enzymes act on a DNA molecule, rendering differences in the final ‘restricted’ or cleaved DNA when these enzymes are applied in vitro. If these polymorphisms are due to changes in a single nucleotide in a sequence, they are called SNPs or single nucleotide polymorphisms. SNPs seem to be one of the most common genetic variations and various SNP genotyping methods are being increasingly employed to study polymorphisms. Polymorphisms arise originally out of mutations but are maintained in populations due to factors such as founder effect, genetic drift, and natural selection. Note that most polymorphisms occur in non-coding regions (that is introns), as coding sequences (or exons) on mutation often produce disease phenotypes. Serotonin transporter polymorphisms have been identified in the promoter region, which is a non-coding part of DNA (5HTTLPR–5HT transporter linked promoter region). 5HTTLPR can be a short or long variant. In those with a short variant, the serotonin transporter expression is low; the short variant is speculated to be associated with a higher incidence of affective disorders, anxiety, and PTSD. But the evidence is inconclusive as most studies are case–control design with significant heterogeneity. In addition, structural brain changes in the form of gray matter volume reduction in areas important for emotional processing, such as the amygdala, have been noted in subjects with the short variant of the promoter region. An altered number of chromosomes is termed aneuploidy. Kato T. Molecular genetics of bipolar disorder and depression. Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences 2007; 61: 3–19. Sadock BJ and Sadock VA.

    },
    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Amino acid activation is an important step in the translation of mRNA to proteins. As tRNAs enter the cytoplasm after release from the nucleus where they are synthesized, they are attached to specific amino acids according to the codon sequences. This is an energy-dependent process called amino acid activation. The energy stored in such activated amino acids is used in making peptide bonds during protein translation. Translation takes place in the cytoplasm on ribosomes, where specific mRNAs are involved. Translation includes three steps—initiation, elongation, and termination. The ribosome contains two sites—peptidyl P site where methionine- containing tRNA initially binds and aminoacyl A site where each new incoming tRNAs with activated amino acids can bind. In the elongation step amino acids are added one by one in a string-like fashion to produce proteins. Chain termination is signalled by one of three codons— UAA, UGA, or UAG. Following this protein synthesis (or sometimes simultaneously at one end of long proteins), post-translational modifications take place to transport the synthesized proteins to appropriate cellular sites. These modifications take place in endoplasmic reticulum and golgi bodies. This includes covalent modifications, protein folding, and tagging with signal peptides to dispatch to appropriate cellular destinations. Glycosylation, proteolysis, phosphorylation, gamma carboxylation, prenylation, ubiquitation, polyamination, and nitration are some of the recognized post-translational modifications. This process is essential in tagging wrongly folded or aberrant proteins to enter lysosomes for destruction. Gong CX et al. Post-translational modifications of tau protein in Alzheimer’s disease.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Each cell undergoes a natural cycle in terms of its replication and nucleic acid synthesis activity. The cell cycle consists of four separate phases: G1, S, G2, and M. G1 stands for growth phase 1, S for synthetic phase, G2 for growth phase 2 and M for mitosis phase. In mitosis the cellular material, including chromosomes, is divided between two daughter cells. Cells can leave G1 phase to enter a G0 phase, also called the quiescent phase as no replicatory activity takes place here. Most of these cells have temporarily or reversibly stopped dividing, for example liver parenchyma, in which case they enter G1 phase on stimulation. Cells such as neurons enter G0 phase indefinitely, but note that this dogma of absolute neuronal cell cycle dormancy is increasingly being challenged. A number of neurodegenerative diseases in humans, such as Pick’s disease, intractable temporal lobe epilepsy, progressive supranuclear palsy, Lewy body disease, and Parkinson’s disease, are thought to be associated with a few neurons retaining the ability to re-enter mitosis, thus disrupting the normal cell cycle.

    "explanation": "DNA and RNA are the most important nucleic acids in the cellular machinery. These nucleic acids are composed of many nucleotides. Nucleotides are phosphorylated versions of nucleosides. Each nucleoside consists of two components: a nitrogenous base and a pentose sugar. There are two types of nitrogenous bases that can constitute a nucleoside—purines and pyrimidines. Purines include adenine and guanine. Pyrimidines include cytosine, uracil, and thymine. Thymine is usually found only in DNA while uracil is specific to RNA. DNA is double stranded with hydrogen-bonded base pairs. In DNA adenine always bonds with thymine (two hydrogen bonds) while cytosine bonds with guanine (three hydrogen bonds). As a result of this specific pairing, the amount of total purines is always equal to the total pyrimidines in normal DNA (Chargaff’s rule). McGuffin P et al., eds. Psychiatric Genetics and Genomics.

    "explanation": "Cloning is the process of copying; cloning laboratory animals refers to making identical genetic copies of the organisms while cloning a gene refers to producing identical copies of the gene. Gene cloning involves the insertion of foreign DNA into vectors such as bacterial plasmids or phages. Replication of these vectors then produces numerous identical copies of the cloned gene. In order to carry out successful cloning, a method of cutting DNA at specific sites to obtain the necessary genetic element is crucial. This is possible using restriction enzymes. DNA ligase (not RNA ligase) is used to paste the cut genetic element with plasmid DNA. A stem cell or ovum is not necessary for gene cloning.

    "explanation": "PCR stands for polymerase chain reaction. It is an amplification process wherein a small amount of DNA sample is amplified many times to provide a supply for diagnostic analyses. The polymerization requires heat-stable DNA polymerase, obtained from Thermus aquaticus. Just one copy of a DNA sequence is sufficient to undertake PCR (at least theoretically). As it is extremely sensitive, contamination from other DNA present in the lab. environment (from bacteria, viruses, and DNA of lab. personnel) presents significant difficulties. As PCR requires the hybridization of primers to known sequences at either side of the region of interest (i.e. flanking regions), completely unknown sequences cannot be polymerized. DNA cloning by PCR can be performed in a few hours, using relatively unsophisticated equipment. Typically, a PCR reaction consists of 30 cycles containing a denaturation, synthesis and reannealing step, with an individual cycle typically taking 3–5 min in an automated thermal cycler. This compares favourably with the time required for cell-based DNA cloning, which may take weeks. PCR is not error free. The DNA polymerases used for PCR usually have no error correction mechanisms such as exonuclease activity. So, if an error is made, initially it may get amplified uncorrected, but this is less of a problem now with the availability of high-fidelity DNA polymerases. McGuffin P et al., eds.

    "explanation": "Patau syndrome results from aneuploidy of chromosome 13 where three copies are found. This is due to non-disjunction of chromosome 13 during meiosis, mostly in the mother. Similar to Down’s, Patau’s syndrome is associated with increasing maternal age. Patau’s syndrome may also occur as a result of random non-disjunction during early cell division, resulting in a mosaic cell population. Rarely, Patau’s syndrome can result from a translocation that leaves the fetus with three copies of chromosome 13. This is often a balanced translocation where almost no significant clinical changes are seen in the carrier, but this can affect the children of the carrier. In non-translocation-related Patau’s syndrome, the chances of a couple having another child with trisomy 13 is less than 1%. Most fetuses with trisomy 13 die in uterus. If survived, the clinical features include mental retardation, microcephaly and holoprosencephaly, structural eye defects, and congenital cardiac anomalies. Patau K et al.

    "explanation": "COMT polymorphism has been widely studied in schizophrenia. COMT stands for catechol-o-methyl transferase. It is an important enzyme in the breakdown of dopamine in prefrontal area of the brain. Though monoamine oxidase is the major enzyme in dopamine metabolism in most other brain regions, COMT assumes special significance in the prefrontal brain area, at least in primates; the dopamine (reuptake) transporter is present at a low density in the prefrontal area compared to the striatum. The gene for COMT is located on chromosome 22q11. The deletion of 22q11 results in velo cardio facial syndrome (VCFS) or di George syndrome. As many as 30% of affected individuals with VCFS meet diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia. The existence of a valine-to-methionine (Val/Met) polymorphism has been noted, stimulating more interest in COMT. Val/Val genotype results in a higher activity form, while Met/ Met is associated with lower activity of the enzyme. The higher activity variant leads to faster breakdown and reduced availability of prefrontal dopamine. This may be associated with poorer working memory function or inefficient prefrontal activity in such tasks. Findings implicating GABA in working memory have been reported. Decreased expression of the GABA biosynthetic enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67), encoded by GAD1, is found in the post-mortem brain tissue of schizophrenia patients. It has been shown that the variation in GAD1 influences multiple domains of cognition, including declarative memory, attention, and working memory. There may be epistasis between SNPs in COMT and GAD1, suggesting a potential biological synergism, leading to increased risk. These coincident results implicate GAD1 in the aetiology of schizophrenia and suggest that the mechanism involves altered cortical GABA inhibitory activity in addition to COMT changes (Straub et al. 2007).

    "explanation": "In genomic imprinting, the disease phenotype expressed depends on whether the allele is of maternal or paternal lineage. This parent-of-origin phenomenon is an important exception to Mendelian inheritance patterns. An often-quoted example is Angelman’s syndrome and Prader–Willi syndrome. These are two clinically distinct, genetic diseases associated with genomic imprinting on chromosome 15q11-q13. Major diagnostic criteria for Prader–Willi syndrome include mental retardation, hypotonia, hyperphagia and obesity, hypogonadism, and maturational delay. In Angelman’s syndrome ataxia, tremors, seizures, hyperactivity, and profound mental retardation are accompanied by outbreaks of laughter (gelastic attacks). Approximately 70% of patients with Prader–Willi syndrome have a deletion in their paternally derived 15q11- q13. Maternal uniparental disomy (inheriting both copies from the mother when the embryo is formed) occurs in most of the remaining patients (25%). Most patients with Angelman’s syndrome have a deletion in their maternally derived 15q11-q13. Paternal uniparental disomy occurs in about 4% of Angelman’s syndrome. This parent-of-origin effect is thought to be due to DNA methylation defects. Genetic anticipation refers to the phenomenon wherein phenotypic expression of a mutation occurs earlier in successive generations. This is seen in Huntington’s disease and other trinucleotide repeat diseases. Autosomal aneuploidy, such as Down’s syndrome, are not ‘inherited’ diseases but show a correlation with maternal age, as an ageing ovum is prone to more cell division errors. This is not the same as the parent-of-origin effect. Falls JG et al. Genomic imprinting: implications for human disease. American Journal of Pathology 1999; 154: 635–647."

Trinucleotide repeats undergo expansion during germ cell division, which further destabilizes the mutant trinucleotide loci and the probability of the phenotypic expression thus increases with every gametogenesis. This occurs more frequently with oogenesis than spermatogenesis, leading to pronounced anticipation in maternally transmitted trinucleotide diseases. Carriers of a heterozygous recessive mutation may show cellular level abnormalities lifelong without overt disease manifestation; this is not genetic anticipation. McGuffin P et al., eds. Psychiatric Genetics and Genomics. Oxford University Press, 2002, pp. 19–20."

Deletion of maternally inherited 15q11-13 (70%) or uniparental disomy where both 15q11-13 come from the father (4%) leads to Angelman’s syndrome. This is because certain genetic loci in 15q11-13 are selectively imprinted (that is inactivated via methylation) according to the parent of origin. When the maternally derived chromosome is absent due to deletion or paternal disomy this produces the phenotype. Similarly, maternally derived disomy or deletion of the paternally derived chromosome can produce Prader–Willi syndrome at the same locus. McGuffin P et al., eds. Psychiatric Genetics and Genomics.

    "explanation": "This question tests one’s knowledge of the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. In a large population where random mating occurs between individuals, a constant and predictable relationship exists between various genotype and allele frequencies. If the frequency of an allele, A, is given by p, then at the same locus a second allele, B, has a frequency q = 1 − p. The frequency of AA individuals is given by p × p = p2. The frequency of BB is thus q2. The frequency of heterozygosity is given by 2pq as the heterozygosity can be AB or BA, both denoting the same constitution. According to the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1. This is true because (p + q)2 = (p + 1 − p)2 = 12 = 1. Note that deviations from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium can occur due to assortative non-random mating, natural selection, genetic drift, or gene flow. McGuffin P et al., eds.

      "E": "None of the above"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Reciprocal translocation refers to exchange of genetic material between two chromosomes. An individual who carries a reciprocal translocation will not be affected clinically as he or she will have the normal complement of all essential genetic material. However, the children of such an individual can inherit partial trisomy or partial monosomy of the translocated chromosomes. Robertsonian translocations occur in approximately 1 in 1000 individuals. This refers to the loss of short arms of two acrocentric chromosomes (which do not have much genetic material) and subsequent fusion of the two chromosomes at ‘sticky’ centromeres. Again there is no effect in the individuals who suffer such a translocation but their children can inherit the effects. Five percent of Down’s syndrome children have inherited a Robertsonian translocation between chromosome 14 and 21, leading to triple copies of chromosome 21. In a mother with a 14:21 translocation, the risk of subsequent children having Down’s syndrome is elevated to 10–15%, irrespective of maternal age. The risk is around 1–2% if the father carries such a translocation. Note that in a mother less than 30 without a translocation who has given birth to a Down’s syndrome baby, the chances of recurrence is only 1%. Inversion refers to a segment of chromosome between two breaks undergoing reinsertion into the same chromosome but in a reverse order. If these breaks occur on either side of a centromere, it is called pericentric inversion. If not, it is termed paracentric inversion. Duplication occurs during formation of chromatids, where more than two sister chromatids are created. Isochromosomes occur when chromosomes divide at a horizontal instead of vertical axis during cell division. Hence daughter chromatids will have two copies of the same arm of a chromosome. This is usually lethal for most chromosomes except the X chromosome, whose isochromosomes can result in Turner’s syndrome in individuals who inherit isochromosome Xq (long arm). This indicates that most determinants of Turner’s syndrome reside in the short arm of the X chromosome. Kumar PJ and Clark ML. Clinical Medicine, 6th edn. Elsevier, 2006, p. 174."

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Monogenic diseases follow single gene–single disease inheritance, as for example in phenylketonuria. However, the most common cause of genetic disorders is thought to be multifactorial or polygenic inheritance. Polygenic diseases are genetic disorders caused by mutations or changes in more than one genetic locus, for example neurofibromatosis can be caused by NF-1 or NF-2 mutations. When environmental factors also play a role in the development of a disease or trait, the term multifactorial is used to refer to the additive effects of many genetic and environmental factors. Multifactorial illnesses, for example diabetes, coronary heart disease, and possibly most psychiatric illnesses, are simultaneously influenced by multiple genes and by environmental factors.

With 75% penetrance, the chances of a child being affected reduces to 75% of the original chance. So 75% × 75% = nearly 57% will be affected. This means that the likelihood of having an unaffected child increases from 25 to nearly 40%. Hence, the lower the penetrance, the higher the likelihood of having an unaffected child. This does not depend on the sex or birth order. Kumar PJ and Clark ML. Clinical Medicine, 6th edn. Elsevier, 2006, p. 169."

      "E": "None of the above"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Gregor Johann Mendel was a monk who was interested in horticulture and botany. He studied garden peas and proposed ‘laws’ of inheritance. The first law is the law of uniformity. According to this law, if two plants that differ in just one trait (black and white) are crossed, then the resulting hybrids will be uniform in the chosen trait (either black or white, not blue). This is not entirely true as later geneticists demonstrated intermediate phenotypes resulting from codominant heterozygous expression. The second law is the principle of segregation. It states that for any particular trait, the pair of alleles of each parent separate and only one allele passes from each parent to an offspring. Which allele in a parent’s pair of alleles is inherited is a matter of pure chance. For example if there are two alleles with one determining white colour and one determining black colour in the first generation, then these two alleles segregate and only one of them from each parent could be passed on to the second generation. This was later proved to be true by studying chromosomes during cell division. The third principle is the principle of independent assortment. It states that different pairs of alleles are passed to offspring independently of each other. The result is that new combinations of genes present in neither parent are possible. As a very simplistic example, if a man with blue eyes and brown hair fathers a child with a woman with brown eyes and black hair, their offspring can have blue eyes and black hair. The inheritance of blue eyes does not take brown hair ‘with it’; these traits are independently assorted. Thus Mendelian principles are applicable to human genetics as well. Note that all traits studied using Mendelian genetics refer to categorical, all-or-none, traits, that is black vs. brown, blue vs. brown, tall vs. short, etc. It does not apply with the same simplicity to dimensional traits such as IQ or blood pressure.

      "E": "Substitution occurs only in coding regions of DNA"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Autosomal recessive traits skip generations and may ‘catch families unaware’. Assuming a good degree of penetrance, an autosomal dominant pattern affects all generations. Mitochondrial diseases will affect all generations but via maternal inheritance. X-linked recessive disorders can skip generations but not X-linked dominant. Autosomal recessive diseases are clinically expressed only in homozygous states. Most commonly, the homozygote is produced by the union of two heterozygous parents (carriers) who themselves will be unaware of harbouring such an allele. The recurrence risk in children born to such parents is 25%. If an affected homozygote marries a heterozygote the recurrence risk is 50%. Consanguinity (union between relatives) increases the likelihood of inheriting autosomal recessive diseases as related parents may have both inherited carrier status for the same disease from their common ancestor.

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Mutation is a sudden, permanent, and heritable change in the DNA sequence. Changes in DNA may be transcribed to mRNA and translated to proteins, leading to disease expression. Point mutation refers to a single base change in DNA. Point mutations are usually substitutions, where one base is replaced by another. It is termed a transition if a purine is replaced by another purine or a pyrimidine replaced by another pyrimidine (e.g. A to G). It is called a transversion if a purine is replaced by a pyrimidine or vice versa (e.g. A to T). According to the effect on the triplet code, mutations could be a frame shift or in-frame. In frame-shift mutations, the deletion or insertion is not in multiples of three codons, for example a five-base deletion mutation. This leads to a shift in the triplet reading frame with variable results. In-frame mutation refers to changes occurring in multiples of three bases, with no disturbances in the reading frame. According to the effect of a mutation on the protein product, mutations could be silent, mis-sense, or nonsense. A silent mutation causes no change in the protein product—this is possible because a single amino acid is often coded by more than one triplet sequence. In a silent mutation one triplet sequence is replaced by a different sequence but without changing the amino acid sequence. In a mis-sense mutation, the new mutant codon specifies a different amino acid with variable effects on the final protein product, for example in haemophilia and sickle cell anaemia. In a nonsense mutation the new codon is UUA, UGA, or UAG, which signal ‘stop’ to the amino acid sequence, resulting in a non-functional protein. Point substitutions do not shift the reading frame; they often occur in non-coding regions and go unnoticed. Even in coding regions they are often silent or mis-sense mutations.

Various methods of age correction have been employed to ascertain the morbid risk precisely in such cases. Weinberger’s weighted age method is a popular approach. Life tables can also be used for age correction. In most genetic disorders, birth order does not play a role in disease expression as each birth is an independent genetic event.

    "explanation": "Epistasis is the term used to describe gene interactions. Epistasis specifically refers to interaction between alleles at different genetic loci. This interaction is evident in the protein production and function of the involved genes. It can occur at the same step or at different stages of the same biochemical pathway. Variable expression refers to the variation in the degree of phenotypic expression seen in certain genetic disorders. Some individuals carrying the phenotype may be severely affected while others will only be mildly affected. This may be due to the effect of environment on a phenotype, allelic heterogeneity (different mutations causing a phenotype, leading to variation in expressed severity), or epistatic influences (another genetic loci conferring protection against severe expression by modifying the biochemical pathway at a distant site). Incomplete penetrance refers to the phenomenon where some individuals with the disease genotype do not display any signs of the disease at all. If the number of obligate carriers of a genotype (individuals who possess a genotype) is 100, and the number showing disease expression is 80, then the penetrance rate is 80%.

    "explanation": "The odds ratio in most psychiatric genetic association studies are in the order of 1 to 2, the median being 1.3. This is insufficient to prove a genetic cause for most disorders. To demonstrate a more significant odds ratio, very large sample sizes are required; this methodological problem is being surmounted, at least partially, by meta-analyses that are providing evidence for the role of certain genes in psychiatric disorders. Non-contingent gene–disorder association refers to the fact that the relationship is not influenced by other factors such as environment or presence of other genes, that is not polygenic or multifactorial. But most psychiatric disorders do not follow non-contingent association models. The causal pathway from an identified genetic abnormality to actual disease expression is too complex and not fully explored in most known genetic markers of psychiatric diseases. For example it is unclear how a mutant dysbindin gene can lead to a belief that aliens are invading earth. There are few notable exceptions to this; for example the role of the serotonin transporter polymorphism in mediating the effects of life events on the risk of depression. For a long time, much genetic research was guided by the assumption that genes cause diseases, but the expectation that direct paths will be found from gene to disease has not proven fruitful for complex psychiatric disorders. Gene × environment interaction models of disease causation appear promising, as in Caspi’s work, and may possibly throw more light on the causal chains from gene to disease.

    "explanation": "It has been demonstrated that the ‘short’ polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) is associated with impaired efficacy of fluvoxamine and paroxetine. The long form is associated with better SSRI efficacy. This can be understood by studying the mechanism of action of SSRIs. SSRIs produce antidepressant action by reducing the activity of serotonin transporter protein. In patients with the short polymorphism of the promoter region, the number of serotonin transporter molecules is reduced, leaving less substrate on which SSRIs can act. Hence the short form is associated with poorer response than the longer form, but this might be confounded by an ethnicity effect as Korean and Japanese patients show the opposite effect (the short version is associated with better SSRI response).

    "explanation": "The name tuberous sclerosis comes from the characteristic tuber or potato-like nodules in the brain, which calcify and become sclerotic. The disorder is also known as epiloia or Bourneville’s disease. Though most infants show signs in the first year of life, clinical features can be subtle initially, leading to misdiagnosis for years. The disease-causing mutations are present in either of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2. TSC1 is present on chromosome 9 and produces a protein hamartin. The TSC2 gene is on chromosome 16 and produces a protein tuberin. The natural course is very variable, ranging from mild to severe illness. In addition to the benign tumours of kidney (cysts, angiomyolipomas), phakomas of eyes, cardiac tumours, and brain tumours (tubers, subependymal nodules, and astrocytomas) that frequently occur in tuberous sclerosis, other common symptoms include seizures, mental retardation, behaviour problems, and skin abnormalities. Malignant tumours are rare and occur primarily in the kidneys. An often quoted dermatological triad consists of adenoma sebaceum (facial angiofibromas), ash-leaf macules (hypomelanotic macules), and shagreen patches (pebbly skin on the nape of the neck). Café-au-lait patches and ungual fibromata are other manifestations of tuberous sclerosis. In most patients, tuberous sclerosis is due to a spontaneous new mutation but in those who inherit tuberous sclerosis, the pattern of inheritance is autosomal dominant. McGuffin P et al., eds.

    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "According to the law of segregation, inheritance of one trait occurs independently of another trait, but this is not always the case. This is due to random crossing over during meiosis, which allows the exchange of genetic segments that are significantly longer than a single gene. Such a crossing over results in the recombination of distant genetic loci. When two loci are close together, recombination is very unlikely and they are inherited as a single genetic element at a frequency significantly more than chance. This is called cosegregation, and the loci are said to be linked. Note that an essential condition for linkage is that the two loci must be on the same chromosome, called as syntenic loci; but not all syntenic loci are linked. Study of such linked loci is called linkage analysis. Restriction fragment length polymorphism is a method of genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms using restriction endonucleases. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) involves denaturation of DNA on microscope slides and binding of sequence-specific DNA probes to the regions of interest on the exposed DNA strands. It is often used to study areas of deletion in chromosomes. McGuffin P et al., eds. Psychiatric Genetics and Genomics. Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 55."

    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The distance between two loci can be measured in terms of the frequency with which they undergo recombination. For linked loci the frequency of recombination is less than 50%. Genetic distances are often expressed in centiMorgans (cM). One cM is equal to 1% recombination frequency between two loci, which can occur if nearly one million base pairs separate the two loci. LOD scores (log of odds) are used to estimate the likelihood that an observed recombination frequency is truly due to the loci being linked. It is given by the log of the ratio between the probabilities of the recombination frequency being the observed value (θ) to the expected value of 50% if they are not linked. A LOD of more than 3 indicates a linkage; less than −2 indicates no linkage. The value of θ at which LOD scores are greatest is the most likely estimate of recombination frequency.

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Gene frequencies and genotype ratios in a randomly breeding population remain constant from generation to generation. This is known as the Hardy–Weinberg law. This holds true only if the population is randomly breeding. If mutations are occurring in two genes at different frequencies, then this does not hold true as gene frequencies would change. In addition, if members of one population breed with occasional immigrants from an adjacent population this will introduce new genes or alter existing gene frequencies in the population. This is called gene flow. Similarly, strong interbreeding can happen within members of local populations. If the population is small, the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium may be violated. As random mating can be assured only if sufficient numbers of matings occur, this is not possible in a small population. In such cases, the frequency of an allele may begin to drift toward higher or lower values. This is called genetic drift; it is accidental and aimless and is not an adaptive genetic change as it does not guarantee that the new generations will be more fit than the predecessors. In natural selection, certain alleles are positively selected and so their frequencies increase compared to other genes. This will result in failure of the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.

Primase acts in the initiation of DNA synthesis by catalyzing the synthesis of RNA primers; this is necessary because DNA polymerases cannot initiate DNA synthesis without the help of RNA primers. When DNA replication is complete, DNA polymerase I destroys the RNA primers. DNA polymerase I contains an exonuclease which helps in proofreading activity during DNA synthesis. Kumar PJ and Clark ML.

    "explanation": "This can be calculated using the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. If p and q are the allele frequencies of recessive copy ‘a’ and dominant copy ‘A’, respectively, then p2 gives the frequency of homozygous aa and q2 gives the frequency of homozygous AA. 2pq gives the frequency of the heterozygous aA. 1/1600 is the frequency of homozygous individuals, that is p2. Hence, p = 1/40. If p = 1/40, then q will be 1 − p = 39/40. The number of heterozygous carriers is given by 2 × 1/40 × 39/40 = 1/20 approximately. As one can see easily from this calculation, at any given time in a population there are more heterozygous carriers than diseased individuals. So negative eugenics, that is elimination of all diseased individuals, cannot eliminate an autosomal recessive disease. Malats N and Calafell F. Basic glossary on genetic epidemiology.

The shared environment and shared genetic make-up are drawn to demonstrate the sources of resemblance between two siblings. Path coefficients are calculated for each connecting path between the sources and the siblings, and the sum of these coefficients can provide a genetic correlation between the siblings.

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The relative influence of genetic factors in defining the variance in a trait is expressed as heritability. If this is defined as the proportion of the total phenotypic variance attributable to additive genetic variance, then it is known as narrow-sense heritability. Heritability is also sometimes used to describe the proportion of variance explained by the total genetic variance (additive and non-additive genetic variance); here it is called broad-sense heritability. Non-additive genetic influences include phenomena such as epistasis (gene–gene interaction) and dominance effects, where presence of one gene mitigates the expression of other gene. A twin pair is said to be concordant when both cotwins have the same disease expression (or both are disease-free). The pair can be discordant if one of them harbors a disease while the other does not. Due to the higher degree of genetic similarity among monozygotic twins, one would expect higher concordance between monozygotic twins compared to dizygotic twins if the disease being studied has a significant genetic component.

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The gene for the MAO-A enzyme is located on chromosome X. In males, a single X chromosome yields two dissimilar MAOA genotype variations: a high and a low activity variant. Females have two copies of the X chromosome, hence they can have three different levels of MAO-A activity: a high–high activity group (homozygous high), a low–low activity group (homozygous low), and a third, heterozygous group with low–high (mixed pattern). Caspi et al. (2002) studied MAO-A related genetic influences on the outcome of childhood maltreatment. They found out that high MAO-A activity exerts a protective influence against the development of antisocial outcomes (such as adolescent conduct disorder, violent episodes, etc.), especially in maltreated boys and to some extent in girls.

On a similar note, dysphoric mania, mixed affective episodes, and rapid-cycling mania respond poorly to lithium treatment. Having a family history of bipolar illness is suggestive of good prophylactic response of lithium in relapse prevention; such an effect is not clearly demonstrated for the effects of lithium in treating acute mania.

      "E": "10–20%"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "First-degree relatives share 50% of their genes in common. This genetic relatedness reduces to 25% among second-degree relatives and 12.5% among third-degree relatives. The possible contribution of genetic factors for a disorder can be studied using the resemblance of disease risk across successive generations. A strong genetic contribution is suggested by a 50% decrement in disease risk with successive generations. If the risk decreases by more than 50% this suggests that the disease is either multifactorial with the possibility of significant gene–environment interaction or a more complex mode of genetic transmission. The ratio of the rate of the disorder in relatives to the population-based rate is commonly denoted by λ. This does not refer to linkage equilibrium. For diseases that are autosomal dominant in inheritance, λ tends to exceed 20; for complex multifactorial disorders, λ derived from family studies tends to range from 2 to 5.

The proportion attributable to non-genetic causes includes shared and non-shared environmental variance, gene–environment covariance, and interaction. The estimate of heritability for major depression from twin studies is around 0.37. The relative risks based on the existing adoption studies suggest that the familial recurrence cannot be attributed solely to shared environmental factors. The remaining 63% of variance is almost wholly attributed to environmental factors unique to the individual. Tasman A, Maj M et al., eds. Psychiatry, 3rd edn. John Wiley and Sons, 2008, p. 260."

The odds of developing Alzheimer’s disease are 2.6−3.2 times greater in those with one copy, and nearly 15 times higher in those with two copies of the APOE e4. A significant protective effect has been noted in those with e2/e3 genotype.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A gene on locus 13q34, called G72, codes for D-amino acid oxidase activator (DAOA). A series of initial studies have identified this genetic locus as potentially contributing to schizophrenia susceptibility. The D-amino acid oxidase is the only enzyme oxidizing D-serine. D-serine is an important coagonist for the NMDA glutamate receptor. Hence it is posited that the variations in the G72 gene may influence the efficiency of glutamate gating at N-methyl-D-aspartate-type (NMDA) receptors, but some later studies have failed to replicate the earlier findings. G72 has also been associated with depression in psychotic patients and also with bipolar disorder. Boks MPM, Rietkerk T, van de Beek MH et al.

      "E": "Mendelian disorders always present in childhood."
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Only a very small percentage (nearly 1.5%) of the human genetic code carried in DNA encodes proteins. This is because a large proportion of human DNA consists of long intron sequences, which are non-coding portions that get spliced out when transcription takes place. Hence, even when the complete sequence of a genome is known, mapping the functional genetic code will be diffi cult. A transcriptome is defi ned as all messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules transcribed from the DNA in a cell. The mRNA molecules act as ‘mediators’ between DNA codes and actual protein products. A transcriptome is not unique for a species or even for an individual; this is because what genes are transcribed in a cell depends on the kind of cell (e.g. WBCs, hepatocytes, epithelial cells) and what function is being carried out by the cell at that time. Hence, environmental infl uences or physiological needs will modify the transcriptome. Ito C and Ouchi Y. Toward schizophrenia genes: Genetics and transcriptome.

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The monozygotic concordance for simple Mendelian disorders is approximately 100%. This is because the penetrance is usually complete (though it may vary) in simple Mendelian disorders. In contrast, penetrance is incomplete in schizophrenia. Phenocopies of schizophrenia are very common; multiple organic and drug-induced states resemble schizophrenia. Locus heterogeneity in the same family is not a feature of simple Mendelian disorders affecting single loci. As the exact genetic localization of schizophrenia is still not certain, locus heterogeneity cannot be determined for schizophrenia, but given the multifactorial nature of schizophrenia, significant locus heterogeneity is very likely. Mendelian disorders need not necessarily present in childhood; many autosomal dominant disorders present clinically only in adulthood. Kendler KS and Eaves L, eds. Psychiatric Genetics.

Formerly, it was believed that genes were almost always present in two copies in a genome, but recently large segments of DNA of various sizes have been found to differ in copy number. Such copy-number variations (or CNVs) can lead to dosage imbalances in both functional (exons) and non-coding (introns) regions. As a result, many genes that were thought to occur in two copies per genome have now been found to be present in one, three, or even more copies. Daar AS, Scherer SW, and Hegele RA.

    "explanation": "Fragile-X patients have more than 200 CGG repeats in the 5’ untranslated region of the fragile-X mental retardation 1 gene (FXMR-1). As in other trinucleotide repeat diseases, these expansions originate from phenotypically normal individuals who carry an intermediate number of unstable repeats (60 to 200). Normal individuals have 6 to 60 repeats. Even in carriers with premutation, longer repeats are observed to be more toxic than shorter, near normal ones. These carriers may show evidence of a neurodegenerative condition distinct from fragile X. The degree of toxicity increases with abundance of the transcript.

      "E": "X-linked dominant"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Genetic testing for Huntington’s disease involves testing the person at risk for the presence of excessive DNA repeats that predict development of clinical features. The test cannot predict the age at which the onset of such symptoms could occur. Almost all patients carry a specific mutant gene at chromosome 4 and the inheritance has complete penetrance. Earlier genetic testing involved linkage analysis with only probabilistic estimates given to at-risk individuals. The tested individuals were given a risk estimate of less than 5% or greater than 95%, based on the results. Since 1993, direct identification of the trinucleotide expansion has been made possible, greatly increasing the accuracy of the test to nearly 100%. Being an autosomal dominant condition, the disease exhibits an all-or-none phenomenon; homozygotes are no more severely affected than heterozygotes. Prenatal testing is possible even when the at-risk parent has not had a test him/herself. In this case, only the proportion of the parent’s risk that is passed on to the fetus can be estimated; often this may not give sufficient information to decide on termination of pregnancies. The disease can occur in persons with apparently no positive family history, though this is extremely rare nowadays. Myers RH. Huntington’s disease genetics. NeuroRx 2004; 1: 255–262."
