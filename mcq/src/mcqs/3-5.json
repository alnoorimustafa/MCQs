        "question": "According to Jellinek’s classification of alcoholism, which of the following types refers to a person who has developed physical and psychological dependence but still maintains the ability to abstain if necessary?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Alpha",
            "B": "Beta",

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "According to Jellinek, drinking behavior is heterogeneous. He described five species of alcoholism. Type alpha represents a purely habitual use without loss of control. A person with alpha alcoholism retains the ability to abstain. Type beta refers to development of physical complications without physical or psychological dependence. Type gamma represents acquired tissue tolerance leading to physical dependence and loss of control. They still maintain the ability to abstain if necessary. Type delta shares the three features of gamma, but the inability to abstain becomes prominent. Type epsilon refers to dipsomania or periodic alcoholism. More recently, various investigators have come up with different classifications, which overlap each other. Murray R, et al, eds. Essential Psychiatry, 4th edn.

        "correct_answer": "E",
        "explanation": "In 1976, Edwards and Gross proposed that not all people who drink too much are dependent on alcohol. They suggested the criteria for an alcohol dependence syndrome. This model forms the basis for the current ICD-10 classification. They noted that dependence was not an ‘all or none’ phenomenon, but lay on a spectrum of severity. The criteria were based on the clinical observation that some of the heavy drinkers manifested an interrelated clustering of signs and symptoms. The criteria are narrowing of repertoire; salience of drinking; increased tolerance to alcohol; withdrawal symptoms; relief drinking; subjective awareness of compulsion to drink; reinstatement after abstinence. Not all the elements need always be present, nor always present with the same intensity. Murray RM, et al. Essential Psychiatry, 4th edn. Cambridge University Press; 2008, p. 198"

        "explanation": "ICD-10 includes six items under dependence, most of which are similar to DSM-IV. For a diagnosis of dependence, three or more items should have occurred in the past year. The ‘strong desire or sense of compulsion to take the substance’ is viewed as a central descriptive characteristic of dependence in ICD-10. This compulsive-use indicator is not included in the concept of dependence described by DSM-IV.

Withdrawal symptoms are minor in most cases, but they can be considerable and even fatal in some. Alcohol withdrawal delirium, commonly known as delirium tremens or ‘DTs’, is the most serious manifestation of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

        "explanation": "Clinical features of alcohol withdrawal syndrome can appear within hours of the last drink (usually 6–12 hours) but alcohol withdrawal delirium typically does not develop until 2–3 days after cessation of drinking. Delirium tremens usually lasts 48–72 hours, but can last longer in some cases. Current diagnostic criteria for withdrawal delirium include disturbance of consciousness, change in cognition or perceptual disturbance developing in a short period, and the emergence of symptoms during or shortly after withdrawal from heavy alcohol intake. The classic clinical presentation also includes hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, hypertension, and diaphoresis. The neurobiological basis for withdrawal is a gradual upregulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors under the influence of chronic alcohol use. Mayo-Smith MF, Beecher LH, Fischer TL, et al.

All the given choices are results of laboratory investigations that may give us a clue of the possible cause for the seizure. Electrolyte imbalance, hypoglycaemia, subdural haematoma, and other substances in blood may be associated with an alcohol-induced seizure. EEG is useful in the setting of the first alcohol withdrawal seizure or where epilepsy is suspected, but not immediately after a seizure when a record of slow delta activity is found whatever the cause of the seizure. However, the inter-ictal EEG is usually within normal limits in alcohol withdrawal seizures, whereas a generalized spike and wave (epileptiform activity) patterns on the EEG points towards generalized epilepsy.

        "explanation": "Benzodiazepines are the first-line treatment in alcohol withdrawal seizures. Lorazepam has been found to be superior to placebo in double-blind placebo-controlled studies of patients with chronic alcohol abuse presenting with a generalized seizure. The European treatment guidelines recommend either diazepam or lorazepam, although lorazepam is recommended over diazepam in the setting of status epilepticus. This is because lorazepam (although it has a shorter half-life than diazepam) maintains a steady plasma state for a longer time than diazepam, which is lipid soluble. The plasma levels of diazepam drop rapidly due to redistribution to fat. Placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated phenytoin to be ineffective in the secondary prevention of alcohol withdrawal seizures. McKeon A, Frye MA and Delanty N. The alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

        "explanation": "General guidelines on the management of alcohol withdrawal advise against the use of neuroleptic agents as the sole pharmacological agents in the setting of delirium tremens, as they are associated with a longer duration of delirium, higher complication rate, and, ultimately, a higher mortality. However, neuroleptic agents have a role as a selected adjunct to benzodiazepines when agitation, thought disorder, or perceptual disturbances are not sufficiently controlled by benzodiazepines. Although haloperidol is well established in this setting, chlorpromazine is contraindicated as it is more epileptogenic. There is little information available on atypical antipsychotics in this regard. Mayo-Smith MF, Beecher LH, Fischer TL, et al. Management of alcohol withdrawal delirium.

        "explanation": "Failure to identify or consider Wernicke’s encephalopathy, and failure to institute adequate thiamine replacement therapy, has an associated mortality of 20%. Wernicke’s encephalopathy is an acute neuropsychiatric condition associated with biochemical brain lesion caused by the depletion of intracellular thiamine (vitamin B1). Although reversible in the early stages, continued depletion leads to cellular energy deficiency, focal acidosis, regional increase in glutamate, and ultimately cell death. Ninety percent of the cases in developed countries are associated with alcohol misuse. This deficiency may be due to dietary deficiency, reduced absorption, and the increased excretion of thiamine seen in alcohol users. Clinical features include delirium with prominent anterograde amnesia, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. Imaging may reveal the presence of small hemorrhages in mamillary bodies and thalami.

In clinical practice, Wernicke’s encephalopathy may be difficult to recognize because all the classic symptoms may not be present. In addition, the symptoms may be colored by the presence of other comorbidities such as withdrawal delirium or seizures.

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Risk factors for developing Wernicke’s encephalopathy include a greater degree of malnutrition and severity of alcohol misuse. Oral thiamine hydrochloride cannot be relied on to provide adequate thiamine to patients at risk. This is because studies show that only a maximum of 4.5 mg of thiamine will be absorbed from an oral dose over 30 mg. In addition, patients with alcohol problems tend to have poor absorption. Therefore, intravenous delivery of high-potency B-complex vitamin therapy containing thiamine remains the standard of care for those patients with suspected Wernicke’s encephalopathy (500 mg of thiamine three times daily for three days), or who are at risk for Wernicke’s encephalopathy (250 mg three times daily for 3–5 days). In the outpatient setting, the administration of a course of intramuscular thiamine 200 mg for 5 days has been recommended because the absorption of thiamine is negated further by continued drinking after hospital discharge.

MATCH is one of the largest randomized trials to have examined psychosocial interventions for people with alcohol-related problems. The study is a multicentric study that involved randomizing over 1700 patients to MET, CBT, or TSF. This study demonstrated that four sessions of MET were as effective for treating alcohol dependence as 12 sessions of CBT or TSF therapy. The benefits from treatment persisted for up to 3 years. Clients with a higher degree of baseline anger fared better with MET than CBT or TSF. MET was found to be more cost-effective than CBT or TSF. The Project MATCH study and smaller patient-matching studies provide support for the effectiveness of TSF programmes. Patients in Project MATCH who received outpatient TSF were most likely to abstain from alcohol during the first post-treatment year. TSF therapy led to a greater length of time before the patient’s first relapse and to a higher percentage of abstinent patients at 1- and 3-year follow-up. Patients in Project MATCH with social networks supportive of not drinking responded better to TSF than MET, and that participation in AA was a mediator of this effect. Project MATCH found that patients who were rated high in ‘meaning-seeking’ fared better with TSF than CBT and MET at 1-year follow-up. Tyrer P and Silk KR.

        "explanation": "Brief interventions are recommended for reduction of alcohol use for patients across age and gender who are heavy or problem drinkers and do not meet the criteria for severe alcohol dependence. Brief interventions are intended to be conducted by health professionals who usually are not involved in addiction treatment, e.g. clinicians in general medical and other primary care settings. Brief interventions may differ in intensity from a single 5-minute session of simple advice to stop drinking to multiple sessions lasting up to 60 minutes each. They generally consist of four or fewer visits. They are generally useful for the prevention of alcohol-related problems in patients who are at risk of developing them. They are not primarily used as a maintenance therapy for fully fledged alcohol use disorders like dependence. The content of brief interventions can be remembered using the acronym FRAMES developed by Miller and Rollnick: feedback about the adverse effects of alcohol; emphasis on personal responsibility for changing the dysfunctional behaviour; advice about reducing or abstaining from the behaviour; a menu of options for further help; empathic stance towards the patient; and an emphasis on self-efficacy.

Using moderate sizes of drinks, clinicians estimate that a single ‘drink’ (1.5 units) increases the blood alcohol level of a 150-pound man by 15–20 mg/dL, which is about the concentration of alcohol that an average person can metabolize in 1 hour.

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Nearly 90% of alcohol is absorbed from small intestine, with the remaining 10% absorbed from the stomach. Alcohol reaches peak blood concentration approximately 45–60 minutes after consumption. Absorption is enhanced by an empty stomach whereas food delays absorption. When the alcohol concentration in the stomach becomes too high, gastric mucus secretion increases, leading to closure of the pyloric valve. This pylorospasm slows down the absorption and protects from rapid intoxication but can lead to vomiting and nausea in drinkers. The intoxicating effects are greater when the blood alcohol concentration is rising than when it is falling; this is called the Mellanby effect. As a result, the rate of absorption directly affects the intoxication response. Nearly 90% of absorbed alcohol is metabolized through oxidation in the liver; the remainder is excreted unchanged by the kidneys and lungs. The rate of oxidation by the liver is constant (15 mg/dL per hour) and independent of plasma alcohol levels; thus alcohol follows zero-order elimination kinetics. Women have a tendency to become more intoxicated than men after drinking the same amount of alcohol; this may be due to differences in absorption kinetics and a lower level of metabolic enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in women"

        "explanation": "AUDIT is a 10-item questionnaire, covering quantity, frequency, inability to control drinking, withdrawal relief, loss of memory, injury, and concern by others. A score of 8 or more indicates that the person is drinking to a degree that is harmful or hazardous, whereas a score of 13 or more in women and 15 or more in men is indicative of dependent drinking. It is a very useful and widely used scale. The CAGE questionnaire is a simple, easily administered instrument that has only four items. A positive answer should raise suspicion of an alcohol problem, and a score of 2 is highly suggestive of one. It takes 30–120 seconds to administer. Aertgeerts et al studied alcohol screening instruments used in general practice. They found that CAGE was an insufficient screening instrument for detecting alcohol misuse or dependence among primary care patients with only 62% sensitivity for males and 54% for females. AUDIT was found to be more effective, with a sensitivity of 83% among males and 65% among females. However, this was using a cut off-point of 5 rather than the usual 8.

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Alcohol-related blackouts are similar to episodes of transient global amnesia; they occur as discrete episodes of anterograde amnesia in association with alcohol intoxication. Despite a specific short-term memory deficit (inability to recall events that happened in the previous 5–10 minutes) during the blackouts and significant subjective distress that follows, patients have relatively intact remote memory and can perform complicated tasks during a blackout. Thus they appear completely normal to casual observers. It is thought that alcohol blocks the consolidation of new memories into old memories via its action on medial temporal structures. Binge drinkers may be particularly prone to alcoholic blackouts due to repeated intoxications. Although amnesia may accompany withdrawal or intoxication-related generalized seizures, not all blackouts are associated with epileptic activity in EEG"

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Children with FAS commonly present with microcephaly rather than macrocephaly. It is well documented that alcohol and its metabolite acetaldehyde can have serious effects on the developing foetus. Currently, the estimated incidence of FAS is between 1 and 3 cases per 1000 live births. It is one of the most frequent causes of birth defects associated with learning disability, and the most common of non-hereditary causes of birth defects. Clinical features of FAS include prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, central nervous system abnormalities, usually with learning disability (up to severe), a characteristic facial dysmorphism (e.g., absent philtrum, fl attened nasal bridge, short palpebral fi ssures, epicanthic folds, and maxillary hypoplasia), and an array of other birth defects such as microcephaly, altered palmar creases, short stature, syndactyly, atrial septal defect and other heart abnormalities. Full-blown foetal alcohol syndrome is seen in the offspring of approximately one-third of alcoholic women drinking the equivalent of 10–15 units daily. It is also more common in women who binge drink. Lowinson JH, Ruiz P, Millman RB and Langrod JG. Substance Abuse: A Comprehensive Textbook, 4th edn. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2005, p. 1052"

        "explanation": "Sedative-hypnotic (includes benzodiazepines, barbiturates and newer ‘z’ hypnotics) withdrawal syndrome is a spectrum of signs and symptoms that occurs after stopping daily intake of a sedative-hypnotic. Common signs and symptoms include anxiety, tremors, nightmares, insomnia, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, postural hypotension, seizures, delirium, and hyperpyrexia. The withdrawal syndrome is similar for all sedative-hypnotics, but the severity and time course depend on the pharmacokinetics of the individual agent used, besides a number of other risk factors. With short-acting medication, withdrawal symptoms typically begin 12–24 hours after the last dose and peak in intensity between 24 and 72 hours after the last dose. If the patient has liver disease or is over the age of 65, symptoms may develop more slowly. With long-acting medication, the withdrawal syndrome usually begins 24 to 48 hours after the last dose and peaks on the fi fth to eighth day. During untreated sedative-hypnotic withdrawal, the EEG may show bursts of high-voltage, low-frequency activity. This may precede a clinical seizure occasionally.

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase) and ALDH (aldehyde dehydrogenase) are the major enzymes involved in the degradation of ethanol; ADH catabolizes alcohol to acetaldehyde, which ALDH breaks down to acetate and water. A number of studies have shown that allelic variants of ADH and ALDH are associated with the risk for developing alcohol dependence. There are many ALDH gene families distributed on several different chromosomes. Family 2 genes (ALDH 2) located on chromosome 12 have been studied the most regarding an association with alcohol dependence. This family of genes encodes mitochondrial enzymes that oxidize acetaldehyde. ALDH 2 has an allelic variant called ALDH 2*2. This ALDH 2*2 variant is found in approximately 50% of the Asian population. Individuals with the ALDH 2*2 variant typically experience a disulfi ram-like reaction when they take alcohol. This is sometimes called the ‘Asian fl ush’ or the ‘Oriental fl ush syndrome’. Several studies demonstrate the protective effect of ALDH 2*2 gene carriers from developing alcohol dependence. The other genes ALDH1, 3, 4 and 5 are responsible for the metabolism of other aldehydes in the body. Similarly a variant allele of the ADH gene (situated on chromosome 4) ADH 2*2 also confers protection to alcoholism, although this relationship is less robust than ALDH2*2.

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "About 30–40% of people with an alcohol-related disorder meet the diagnostic criteria for a major depressive disorder sometime during their lifetime. It is more common in women. It is dose dependent, i.e. it is likely to occur in patients who have a high daily consumption of alcohol. It is also more common in those with a family history of alcohol abuse. Patients with depression and comorbid alcohol use disorders are at a greater risk for attempting/completing suicide and are likely to have other substance-related disorder diagnoses. Most estimates of the prevalence of suicide among people with alcohol-related disorders range from 10–15%, although alcohol use itself may be involved in a much higher percentage of suicides. Twenty to 50 percent of all people with alcohol-related disorders also meet the diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder.

        },
        "correct_answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Acamprosate’s principal neurochemical effects have been attributed to antagonism of NMDA glutamate receptors, which restores the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission that is dysregulated following chronic alcohol consumption. Recently, however, further mechanisms have been demonstrated. Thus acamprosate is said to have four principal effects: A) reducing post-synaptic excitatory amino acid neurotransmission at N-methyl-D- aspartate (NMDA); B) diminishing Ca2+ infl ux into the cell, which interferes with expression of the immediate early gene c-fos; C) decreasing the sensitivity of voltage-gated calcium channels, and D) modulating metabotropic-5 glutamate receptors (mGluR5). The most common side effects are headache, diarrhoea, fl atulence, abdominal pain, paraesthesias, and various skin reactions. Acamprosate is not metabolised by liver and is excreted unchanged by the kidney. Administration of disulfi ram or diazepam does not affect the pharmacokinetics of acamprosate. Coadministration of naltrexone with acamprosate produces an increase in concentrations of acamprosate. Effect of acamprosate is dose dependent and has been confi rmed by at least two studies in humans. Johnson BA.

        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Disulfi ram inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase producing a marked increase in blood acetaldehyde concentration if alcohol is consumed. The accumulation of acetaldehyde produces a wide array of unpleasant reactions, called the disulfi ram–ethanol reaction, characterized by nausea, throbbing headache, vomiting, hypertension, fl ushing, sweating, thirst, dyspnoea, tachycardia, chest pain, vertigo, and blurred vision. The reaction occurs almost immediately after the ingestion of one alcoholic drink and can last from 30 minutes to 2 hours. A person taking disulfi ram must be instructed that the ingestion/use of any quantity of alcohol (including alcohol- containing preparations of medicines, food, and cosmetics) would lead to the unpleasant reaction with dangerous consequences at times. Disulfi ram should not be administered until the person has abstained from alcohol for at least 12 hours. This reaction can occur as long as 1–2 weeks after the last dose of disulfi ram.

            "E": "Reverse tolerance"
        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Learned tolerance refers to a reduction in the effects of a drug because of compensatory mechanisms that are acquired by past experiences. One type of learned tolerance is called behavioural tolerance. This simply describes the skills that can be developed through repeated experiences of attempting to function despite a state of mild to moderate intoxication. A common example is learning to walk in a straight line despite the motor impairment produced by alcohol intoxication. This probably involves both acquisition of motor skills and the learned awareness of one’s defi cit, causing the person to walk more carefully. At higher levels of intoxication, behavioural tolerance is overcome, and the defi cits are obvious. Pharmacokinetic, or dispositional, tolerance refers to changes in the distribution or metabolism of a drug after repeated administrations such that a given dose produces a lower blood concentration than the same dose did on initial exposure. This may be mediated via enzyme induction. Pharmacodynamic tolerance refers to adaptive changes that have taken place within the systems affected by the drug so that the response to a given concentration of the drug is reduced, e.g. change in receptor density. Conditioned tolerance is the process where environmental cues, e.g. sight, smell, etc, for the substance will no longer produce a manifestation of the drug’s effect. Reverse tolerance, or sensitization, refers to an increase in response with repetition of the same dose of the drug. Zack M and Vogel-Sprott M.

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Genetic and familial factors probably account for most cases of alcohol problems that begin in adulthood and continue through to older age. Late-onset cases are associated with much lower rates of family alcoholism. Compared with early-onset cases, late-onset problem drinkers also tend to have less psychopathology. In fact, the notion that late-onset alcohol dependence usually occurs secondary to a mood or organic mental disorder has not been upheld in recent systematic studies. The inability to cope with major losses, chronic psychosocial strains, or transient negative affects such as depression or loneliness, are associated with new or renewed problem drinking. The pathophysiological effects of alcohol may be more serious in elderly people because of an age-related increase in biological sensitivity to alcohol and in peak blood level following a standard alcohol load. In addition, alcohol also aggravates many pre-existing diseases that are more common in later life. Gelder MG, et al., eds. New Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry. Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 1638"

        },
        "correct_answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Disulfiram is generally considered a deterrent. Earlier works suggested disulfiram to be an aversion treatment. The theory underlying ‘aversion therapy’ is that ‘repeated pairing’ of alcohol with an unpleasant stimulus leads to a conditioned response in which drinking alcohol is increasingly perceived as unpleasant. This was previously considered to be the case with disulfiram, because it was common practice to induce the highly unpleasant but controlled disulfiram–ethanol reaction in a clinical setting before initiating regular therapy. This is now considered unnecessary for the efficacy of disulfiram therapy, i.e. the ‘unpleasant’ outcome need not be experienced by the person, but a ‘fear’ of the possibility of such experience is sufficient. An analogy is with police cars. Brewer states that no sane driver will exceed the speed limit if he sees a police car in front or behind; one does not need to be arrested for speeding before reducing the speed. Most patients who take disulfiram under supervision do not risk drinking. Those who do drink do not necessarily get a significant reaction on standard doses of disulfiram, but if the experience is unpleasant, they do not usually repeat it. Some people may consider this as a form of negative reinforcement, which again needs the subject to experience the ‘repeated conditioning’ in order to increase the abstinence behaviour. So, from the given choices, deterrence theory would be the best choice. Deterrence is an established theme in criminal justice. It refers to reduction in unwanted behaviour through knowledge of costs and risks involved in an act. Brewer C.

        },
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Symptoms associated with the withdrawal of benzodiazepine therapy may reflect one of three phenomena – a recurrence (return of the original symptoms); a rebound (worsening of the original symptoms), or true withdrawal (emergence of new symptoms). These symptoms may include anxiety, dysphoria, irritability, altered sleep–wake cycle, daytime drowsiness, tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, hyperreflexia, muscle tension, agitation/motor restlessness, tremor, myoclonus, muscle and joint pain. Patients may also experience various perceptual disturbances such as hyperacusis, depersonalization, blurred vision, and hallucinations. In severe cases, delirium similar to delirium tremens has been reported. Factors influencing the development of the discontinuance or withdrawal syndrome include the dose of the drug, duration of the drug intake, rapid tapering of the dose and greater psychopathology before initiation and termination of medication, dependent personality traits, and lower education levels.

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Alcoholic hallucinosis is a condition in which auditory hallucinations are present during clear consciousness in the absence of autonomic overactivity, usually in a person who has been drinking excessively for many years. Initially the hallucinations are simple in nature, but later on become complex voices that are derogatory. These voices are usually second person, but at times are third person. They may also be command hallucinations. Delusions, if present are secondary to the voice. In both ICD-10 and DSM-IV, the disorder is classified as a substance-induced psychotic disorder. The differential diagnosis includes withdrawal symptoms and delirium tremens. In both these conditions the auditory hallucinations are transient and disorganized, and in the latter, consciousness is impaired. Auditory hallucinations of alcoholic hallucinosis are persistent and organized, and occur during clear consciousness. The hallucinations usually respond rapidly to antipsychotic medication. The prognosis is good; usually the condition improves within days or a couple of weeks, provided that the person remains abstinent. Symptoms that last for 6 months generally continue for years. The other differential diagnosis one needs to rule out, especially in the presence of derogatory hallucinations, is major depression with psychotic symptoms. Gelder MG, et al., eds.

        "correct_answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Cocaine inhibits the normal reuptake of monoamines from the synaptic cleft by binding to transporter proteins. Its reinforcing effects are primarily due to its actions at the dopamine transporter, producing high levels of dopamine in the synapse. Cocaine also inhibits reuptake of noradrenaline and serotonin. The increase in noradrenaline concentration is important for some of cocaine’s toxic effects. The drug produces increases in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol by stimulating release of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Acutely, cocaine also stimulates the release of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and suppresses the release of prolactin. Goldman D, Oroszi G and Ducci F.

        "explanation": "Buprenorphine is preferable to α2 adrenergic agonists if there are concerns about bradycardia or hypotension. Buprenorphine results in lower severity of withdrawal symptoms than α2 adrenergic agonists. Buprenorphine can be used for short-term opioid withdrawal and has a better outcome than clonidine. Methadone and α2 adrenergic agonists (e.g. clonidine and lofexidine) also have a good evidence base for reducing withdrawal symptoms. If a short duration of treatment is desirable, α2 adrenergic agonists are preferable to methadone. Methadone treatment is more successful if carried out slowly or with a linear dose reduction. Methadone can be used during pregnancy, and there are emerging studies regarding the use of buprenorphine. α2 adrenergic agonists should not be prescribed in pregnancy.

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Recent research has shed new light on the mechanisms involved in the development of opioid tolerance and dependence. Stimulation of opioid receptors located on critical cells such as those located in the locus coeruleus produces a decrease in cell firing. This effect reflects cellular hyperpolarization that results from both the activation of potassium channels and the inhibition of slowly depolarizing sodium channels. These actions occur in conjunction with a decrease in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Among the given choices, both constipation and miosis have been traditionally thought to be resistant to tolerance. Kollars and Larson reviewed the two studies conducted in the late 60s which are often quoted to show that miosis does not develop tolerance. They quote a number of other studies which have shown that miosis is susceptible to tolerance. There are comparatively few data refuting the lack of tolerance response for constipation. Clinical experience hints that constipation is a major problem that persists without development of tolerance, especially in elderly people who are prescribed opiates as analgesics. This can be very difficult to treat, at times requiring enemas and in severe cases requiring manual evacuation. Kollars JP and Larson M. tolerance to miotic effects of opioids.

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The view of treatment of opiate dependence has changed over the past 25 years. Previously it was thought that all patients should undergo withdrawal prior to delivery. Current practice acknowledges the fact that an abstinence state is almost impossible to achieve in this population. Hence most experts now advocate methadone maintenance as a way to reduce illegal drug use and remove the woman from a hazardous drug-seeking environment. Current consensus is that undertaking a medical withdrawal regimen could be accomplished most safely during the second trimester, with careful monitoring of foetal welfare by perinatal experts. The consensus is that opiate withdrawal could be best accomplished through stabilization with methadone followed by gradual reduction of the methadone dosage by 2–2.5 mg every 7–10 days. This should ideally be done only in a secondary care setting with the involvement of obstetricians and neonatologists. Lowinson JH, Ruiz P, Millman RB and Langrod JG.

DSM-IV states that opiate withdrawal can be precipitated by cessation of (or reduction in) opioid use that has been heavy and prolonged (several weeks or longer) or administration of an opioid antagonist after a period of opioid use. Other symptoms typically associated with withdrawal are dysphoric mood, nausea or vomiting, muscle aches, rhinorrhoea, pupillary dilation, piloerection, sweating, diarrhoea, yawning, fever, and insomnia. Piloerection along with general ‘secretion’ from most of the glands is called the ‘cold turkey’, when people tend to detox without medical help. Sadock BJ and Sadock VA.

Methadone maintenance treatment has also been shown to reduce risk behaviours (specifically reduction in needle sharing) and thereby has achieved a reduction in the transmission of HIV. Intake of illicit opioids decreased in the methadone maintenance group, as shown by fewer positive urine tests for ‘morphine’ in these groups. Although criminal activity was found to be less in the group that was on methadone maintenance, the statistics did not show a significant difference. Nevertheless, individual randomized controlled trials have shown that methadone maintenance decreases criminal activity.

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Elimination of most synthetic opioids is complex. The peak plasma concentrations of oral methadone are reached within 2–6 hours, and initially plasma half-life is 4–6 hours in opioid-naive people and 24–36 hours after steady dosing of any type of opioid. It generally requires once-daily dosing. Methadone is highly protein bound and equilibrates widely throughout the body, which ensures little post-dosage variation in steady-state plasma concentrations. Methadone can be used for short-term detoxification (7–30 days), long-term detoxification (up to 180 days), and maintenance (treatment beyond 180 days) of opioid-dependent individuals. In contrast, the elimination of a sublingual dosage of buprenorphine occurs in two phases: an initial phase with a half-life of 3–5 hours and a terminal phase with a half-life of more than 24 hours. Buprenorphine dissociates from its receptor binding site slowly, which permits an every-other-day dosing schedule. Sadock BJ and Sadock VA.

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mu (MOP) receptors are found in the brain in the cortex, thalamus, striosomes, and periaqueductal grey. The Mu1 subtype is responsible for supraspinal analgesia and physical dependence. The Mu 2 subtype is responsible for respiratory depression, euphoria, constipation, physical dependence, and miosis. Kappa (KOP) receptors are found in the hypothalamus, claustrum, and periaqueductal grey regions of the brain and the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord. They are involved in spinal analgesia, sedation, miosis, and inhibition of ADH release. Delta (DOP) receptors are seen in the brain in the regions of the pons, amygdala, olfactory bulbs, and the deep cortex. Their function includes analgesia, euphoria, and physical dependence. Sigma receptors, which mediate the antitussive action, are no longer considered to be opioid receptors. A new receptor called ORL1 has recently been identified, with an endogenous ligand called nociceptin. The ORL1 receptors do not bind opioid peptides or opiate drugs. This system is widely distributed in the brain and spinal cord. Its activation produces hyperalgesia in most instances. Many do not consider ORL1 as an opiate receptor. The International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology has recently agreed to rename mu, kappa, and delta to MOP, KOP and DOP receptors respectively.

Field studies of chronic heavy cannabis users in societies with a tradition of such use have not produced consistent evidence to demonstrate the existence of amotivational syndrome.
